## GraphQL API Usage Limits

New Relic's GraphQL API (NerdGraph) enforces a limit of **25 concurrent GraphQL requests per user**.

NerdGraph does not limit the rate of requests you can make, only the number of _concurrent_ requests you make.

Concurrency is tracked and enforced per-user, _not_ per-API key. Requests made by the same user via multiple API keys will all contribute to a user's total concurrency.

NerdGraph _may_ allow more than 25 concurrent connections per user based on the state of the system, but **only 25 concurrent requests are guaranteed.**

Additional requests to the API that are made while you already have 25 concurrent requests in flight will be rejected with HTTP status code `429`. As your in-flight requests complete and your total concurrency drops, new requests will automatically begin to succeed again.

### How to avoid hitting the concurrency limit

If you are making concurrent requests to NerdGraph in your code it's important that you limit the total concurrency client-side. For example, if you need to make 100 requests you could:

 * Send the requests in batches of 25 concurrent calls.
 * Implement a pooling solution to ensure requests are only made when a concurrent connection is "available."
 * Replace concurrent code with sequential code and only make a request after the previous request has completed.

  Also be mindful of code that is run in multiple places at once. Even non-concurrent code will create concurrency if it's being run in multiple places.
</Callout>

NerdGraph is our main API for querying data and making configurations to New Relic features. If you're new to GraphQL, try out the tutorial below to get acquainted with NerdGraph.

<Callout variant="tip">
In case you missed it, check out our [Nerdgraph overview](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).
</Callout>

## Find the explorer [#find]

To find the NerdGraph explorer:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**.
2. In the left pane, click **Apps**.
3. In the main pane, click **NerdGraph API explorer**.

## Before you begin 

Before you do the tutorial here, be sure you've reviewed [Introduction to NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). 

Go to [the explorer](#find) and log in using your New Relic user ID and password.

Make sure you have a valid New Relic . You can create one from the NerdGraph explorer or view and create them in the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).

## Step 1. Set up NerdGraph

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and log in with your <InlinePopover type="userKey" />.
2. In the left pane, click **Apps**.
3. In the main pane, click **NerdGraph API explorer**.
4. In the API key dropdown, either select an existing [user API key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-key) or add a new one.

    <img

        alt="Screenshot of how to set API key in Nerdgraph"
        src={aPIsScreenshotAPIKeyinNerdGraph}
    />

## Step 2. Build a query to retrieve your name [#build-query]

Let's start with a simple NerdGraph query to search for your name in the GraphQL API:

If this is your first visit to NerdGraph, you will probably see the query below. If you don't see the basic query below, erase everything in the query editor, and select these fields in the query explorer in this order: `actor`, `user`, `name`:

```graphql
{
  actor {
    user {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the `name` field, which is nested within the `user` field. This refers to the user who owns the [API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key), which in turn is nested within `actor`.

## Step 3. Click the red **Execute Query** button to see the result [#click-play]

The results have almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the query builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the magnifying glass icon next to the field.

<img

  alt="NerdGraph docs and tooltips"
  src={apisanddataNerdGraphInternalDocs}
/>

## Step 4. Add more fields to your query [#add-fields]

Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the query builder: The explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, add the following fields:

* `id`: This is your account id. You can find this by clicking on your name in the lower-left corner and then clicking **API Keys**.
* `email` 

When you run the query, it returns only the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching data. Notice that the `id` field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need.

```graphql
{
  actor {
    user {
      name
      email
    }
    account(id: INSERT_YOUR_OWN_ACCOUNT_ID )
  }
}
```

## Step 5. Experiment with mutations [#mutations]

In GraphQL, [mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (in REST APIs, these are commonly referred to as CRUD operations).

Ready for your first mutation?

1. Erase what's in the editor.
2. Scroll down the query builder and expand `mutation`.
3. Scroll down to `tagging` and select `taggingAddTagsToEntity`.
3. Select the following fields:
    * `guid!`: You can find this by opening **All entities**, clicking the **...*** icon in your entity record, and the clicking **See metadata & tags**.
    * `tags!`: Then, select the child fields of `key!:` and `values`. 
<img
  title="Mutation example"
  alt="Mutation example"
  src={apisanddataNerdGraphMutationExample}
/>


In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select `errors`: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses).

<Callout variant="tip">
Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get.
</Callout>

## Step 5. Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal [#query-terminal]

Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations:

1. Select the **Tools** menu.
2. Copy the query as a curl call or as a [New Relic CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/newrelic-cli) command.

<img
  title="NerdGraph tools menu"
  alt="NerdGraph tools menu"
  src={apisanddataNerdGraphToolsMenu}
/>

```bash
# curl version
curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Api-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \
  --data-binary '{"query":"{\n  actor {\n    user {\n      name\n      email\n    }\n    account(id: 12345678)\n  }\n}\n", "variables":""}'

# New Relic CLI version
newrelic nerdgraph query '{
  actor {
    user {
      name
      email
    }
    account(id: 12345678)
  }
}'
```

## Next steps [#next-steps]

Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation.

Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the query builder (be careful with mutations though, as they could result in changes to your account). Check out some of the example requests in the section below. 

For more information on NerdGraph and explore other projects from the developer community, check out [Explorer's Hub posts](https://discuss.newrelic.com/search?q=nerdgraph).

## Other example requests [#more-examples]

Here are some other examples of NerdGraph requests that may be helpful: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-account-user"
    title="Query accounts a New Relic user can access"
  >
    You can query for the name of an account that an `actor` (a New Relic authorized user) has access to:

    ```graphql
    query {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          name
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want.

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "actor": {
          "account": {
            "name": "Data Nerd"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-multiple-requests"
    title="Query user, account, and NRQL in one request"
  >
    The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints.

    ```graphql
    query {
      actor {
        account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
          name
          nrql(query: "SELECT * FROM Transaction") {
            results
          }
        }
        user {
          name
          id
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

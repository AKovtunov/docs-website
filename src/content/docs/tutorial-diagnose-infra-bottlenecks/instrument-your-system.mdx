title: Collect data about your system infrastructure
metaDescription: Capture data about your system by installing agents, then view that data in New Relic. 
---

Like the bridges and roads of a dense city, your system infrastructure needs regular inspection and maintenance. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts? The performance of your infrastructure can affect the performance of your APIs, services, and apps. A database failure can prevent your server from handling data, or a memory leak can bring an otherwise performant app to an abrupt halt. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial series walks you through using infrastructure data to troubleshoot different incident scenarios. While New Relic offers a full suite integrations to monitor the Cloud, containerized environments, and various virtual machines, this series is specific to data reported with an infrastructure agent that does not have additional integrations.

That said, this doc explains how you might fully instrument your system. You will:

* Install the infrastructure agent with our guided install
* Understand the guided install's recommendations so you can make an informed decision about instrumentation
* Learn about infrastructure integrations 

## Install the infrastructure agent  [#install]

When you observe your infrastructure in context, you can respond to incidents with more clarity and direction, letting you move from reaction to proaction in your incident response.

    ### Start with our guided install  

To install the infrastructure agent, we recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=a36f15a1-c5ce-528c-2ec2-8bcaacc40c03). Our guided install is a CLI installer that lets New Relic inspect, then make recommendations about additional instrumentation to your system. These recommendations are for our agents and any integrations relevant to your system.

### Instrument your system with agents

The fidelity of your data largely depends on what you've chosen to report to New Relic. It's the difference between purchasing a point-and-shoot camera that may capture the essence of a scene without the detail, or a professional DSLR camera that brings a scene back to life. 

When we recommend that you fully instrument your system,  we mean that you install an agent or integration that can capture data on any server, Cloud host, virtual machine, service, or app. When the guided install makes recommendations to you, it's letting you know that there's an agent (or integration) available to capture data for that potential source. 

Let's take an example of a system and what the guided install might recommend:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                An example system uses...
            </th>
            <th>
                The guided install recommends...
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                A Windows, MacOS, or Linux operating system to run its hosts
            </td>
            <td>
                The infrastructure agent
            </td>
        </tr>
                <tr>
            <td>
                Java virtual machines 
            </td>
            <td>
                The JMX integration
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Azure virtual machines  
            </td>
            <td>
                The Microsoft Azure cloud integration 
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                A few Springboot apps
            </td>
            <td>
                The Java APM agent 
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Microservices written in Ruby and Go
            </td>
            <td>
                The Ruby **and** Go APM agents
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The guided install, then, would recommend:

* The infrastructure agent with two additional integrations for Azure and Java virtual machines
* The Java, Ruby, and Go agents for your apps

    </Step>
    <Step>

Once installed, you can find your infrastructure data in our UI. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**. You're now looking at a summary page about your instrumented hosts. 

<img
    title="Infrastructure UI hosts summary page"
    alt="A screenshot of the first page in the infrastructure UI when you go from All Capabilities to Infrastructure. It displays data about your hosts."
    src={hostSummaryPage}
/>

Each host page has a filter bar, metric graphs, and a summary table. The data represents changes in your golden metrics over timeâ€”that is, changes in host CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and disk utilization. 

    </Step>
    </Steps>

## How do agents and integrations relate to each other? [#agent-integration]

When you install the infrastructure agent, you're installing a piece of software that can integrate to any number of technologies. The agent collects the data it has access to, then reports that data to New Relic, where you can explore it via our UI.

To get even more specific, installing the infrastructure-version of our agent gives New Relic access to your operating system. Once installed in your OS, the infrastructure agent can then integrate with your Cloud provider, flavor of virtual machine, or container orchestration. Because there are as many system configurations as there are orgs who implement them, we have you install the infrastructure agent as a stopgap. This lets you customize how the infrastructure agent is enabled. For example, if you use Microsoft Azure but not AWS, then you can ignore the AWS integration and install the Microsoft Azure integration. 

If you opted out of an installation with our guided install but since changed your mind, you can check out our integration offerings at our [Introduction to infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) doc.

A new campaign has launched and your team has create a new page for it. It's heavily advertised on your landing page and your team optimized the page's written content to capture new organic traffic from search engines. But user engagement is down. Your dev and engineering teams haven't reported any outages or resource bottlenecks, and from your team's perspective everything looks good. What are your next steps?

Website performance monitoring (WPM) can help you identify if certain elements or content on your site is affecting page performance. Maybe a broken link is causing a 404, or maybe your team needs to optimize page elements like images or videos. Whatever the case, WPM empowers your digital marketing team to troubleshoot and correct any page-related performance issues from their end before looping in external teams.

## Objective [#objective] 

This tutorial runs through possible scenarios for increasing user engagement with WPM:

* Acting on data about the user experience of your critical pages
* Optimizing page assets for quicker load times

## Fix broken links that disrupt user journeys [#broken-links]

Unlike a website grader, WPM lets you view your critical pages in context of each other. If user engagement is down but your site is available and content is optimized, then something else might be at play. With WPM, your monitors routinely ping your chosen pages and report back. A possible journey to troubleshoot might look like:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**.
2. You check the availability of your page. It reads as available. 
3. Your core web vitals are reporting as **Good** across the board.
4. You notice the timeslice data shows a steep drop-off in traffic the day before, around the time updates to your landing page were made.
5. On the WPM page for your landing page, you see a broken link has been reported. It's a boilerplate banner that's used across other areas of your site.

At this point, you can coordinate with the relevant teams to fix the broken link and deploy an update for the rest of the site. 

## Optimize your campaign page assets [#optimize]

WPM lets you visualize how different types of assets perform relative to each other. In the **Core web vitals** section, you can view four bar graphs that show your content's size, load time, their resources, and how the network affects them. Using two or more of these graphs can help you identify if, say, your CSS assets are causing load issues.

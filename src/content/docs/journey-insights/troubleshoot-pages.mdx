Once your monitors report data to New Relic, your WPM page displays metrics that can help you improve user experience. WPM gives you four kinds of data:

* Ping data
* Core web vitals
* Content
* Misc.

## Objectives [#objectives]

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand what kind of data WPM tells you about your site's performance using our real world example. 

## Understand your data [#understand]

If a website grader provides a snapshot of your data, then you can think of developer-grade data as a video. All WPM data measures a certain site capability, component, or behavior against time. It tells you two things:

* How long it takes a site functionality to respond to a request.
* How your current site compares to previously collected data.

### Ping

<img
    title="ping"
    alt="ping"
    src={pingWPMPingDataWpm}
/>

The first section of WPM shows you ping data. This kind of data is an availability check, confirming basic site functionalities:

* **Site availability**. This reports whether your page has loaded at all. If it hasn't, there might be an issue with your servers or domain.
* **Page load time**. This collects the median speed for how long it takes your page to load all of its assets. This data gets further broken down later on.
* **SSL Validity**. This tells you whether your SSL certificate is valid, expiring, or expired. It'll include the date you need to renew your SSL certificate as well.
* **Broken links**. After testing all the links on your page, it'll report back which links are broken. 

Because of how WPM collects data, these checks update as often as you've configured your monitors to deploy. If something changes between the times you've manually checked your page, your monitors will report that change and alert you.

### Core web vitals

<img
    title="core"
    alt="core"
    src={coreWPM}
/>

Google PageSpeed reports your core web vitals alongside other metrics collected by New Relic. This data gives you insight into how users experience your site. 

* **First contentful paint**. This captures the time it takes for the first asset to load on a page. In the above screenshot, it took the site 3.22s for something to load on the page. 
* **Largest contentful paint**. Unlike first contentful paint, this captures the time taken for the main content on the page to fully load. For example, if information about an important campaign appears in a page's main asset, then this number tells us how long a user waits before seeing it. In the above screenshot, it took 2.79s. 
* **First input delay**. When a user interacts with an element on your site, it takes time to process the user's interaction This number captures that time as a delay between the request (user interaction) and response (how the page changes based on the user request).
* **Cumulative layout shift**. This measures visual stability of different assets on your site. For example, after a user goes to your site's main page, images may shift while loading. This movement is unanticipated and should be minimized to < 0.1s. 

<img
    title="sdfasdf"
    alt="adgadsf"
    src={gifMakeThisaGif}
/>

New Relic contextualizes this data over time. You can click and drag over relevant parts of this chart, which gives you more granular insight about site behavior. When you're finished, click the time stamp button at the top to adjust back to your preferred time period. 

### Content

<img
    title=""
    alt=""
    src={}
/>

If page load speed is slow, then you can use the **Content** section to diagnose potential sources of the problem relative to each other. For example, comparing **Content size** to **Content load time** can give insight into whether CSS is taking up too many resources and loading last, which would cause a delay in largest contentful paint. 

### Misc.

Your WPM data is collected by a set of monitors deployed from different servers around the world, allowing you to test how users from different areas around the world experience your site.

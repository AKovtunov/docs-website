A website represents the combined efforts of multiple teams, each mapping their own success atop site performance. When a site outage affects a developer or engineering team's KPIs, they can identify and resolve the issue with direct access to the frontend or backend. A digital marketer has a different situation. Your team's success is just as dependent on site performance, but you may lack either the tools or expertise to address the issue yourselves.

Our website performance monitoring (WPM) tool can give you developer-grade insight about your website. You can set it up without installation or involving your dev team, and immediately explore relevant data about your site's performance. This tutorial walks you through setting up and understanding that data, so you can empower your team to take control of your customer experience.

## Objectives [#objectives]

If you're on a marketing team, this tutorial shows how you can collect and act on data about site assets without the technical resources of a developer or engineering team. In this tutorial, you will:

* Set up monitoring for two pages with website performance monitoring 
* Identify actions your marketing team can take based off developer-grade insights
* Explore other New Relic capabilities that can improve your site  

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Get data without installation

    Accessing website performance monitoring requires at least one URL. After pasting it in, New Relic deploys a series of monitors from different servers around the globe. Each monitor runs a scheduled check for website availability, broken links, and SSL certificate expiration. 

    To get to website performance monitoring, go to **[one.newrelic.com > Website performance monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/website-grader)**. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Choose your URL 

    Your very first step to using WPM is choosing a page. WPM doesn't monitor your entire site, only individual pages that you've chosen. We recommend choosing these pages:

    * Your homepage.
    * Pages with critical assets, like important videos, images, or links.
    * Pages critical to your customer funnel

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Paste in URL

<img
    title="Insert your URL"
    src={step1WpmStep1}
/>

WPM requires no installation or set up. Once you've chosen your page, paste in the URL. New Relic will take a few minutes to deploy our monitors, then you'll start receiving data about your website. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add Google PageSpeed API key 

When you set up WPM for the first time, New Relic generates some of your **Core Web Vitals** metrics via Google PageSpeed. To receive continuous data about your app, you need to set up PageSpeed with your own account.

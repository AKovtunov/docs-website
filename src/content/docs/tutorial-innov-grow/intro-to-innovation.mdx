Overall, a business's digital operations are only as stable as its code. Without a stable code base, engineering will never have time to meet even basic demand for new features, let alone move at the pace required to reach the leading edge. High quality code is key to an organization's ability to innovate and grow. Poor quality code diverts engineering time that could be used for innovation, instead wasting it on troubleshooting and fixing. Poor quality code also has a strong negative impact on customer satisfaction and revenue.

This tutorial helps you identify specific key performance indicators and processes that drive stability through code quality improvement. It focuses on improving the quality of your development first, then improving the quality of your releases. 

You're a good candidate for using this guide if:
* You're not measuring code quality.
* Your code quality is perceived as poor.
* You don't understand where your developers are spending their time.
* Your organization suffers from too many outages due to application defects.

## Before you begin [#getting-started]

You should be familiar with the New Relic platform before you can use it to improve your development quality. If you're totally new to our platform, no worries! You can take [this New Relic University course](https://learn.newrelic.com/overview-course) to get you up to speed fast. It's also a good idea to familarize yourself with the following:

The entity filter bar lets you filter down to the entities you want to examine, and lets you save the filtered views you like for later use.

Some tips for using the filter bar: 

* Type in a **string** of characters and/or numbers (for example, an environment) to find any entity that has this string in their name or ID. When typing, the UI suggests items that coincide with the string you're entering, so you can select one of those from the dropdown. You can also filter by the name of the **entity**, the **entity type**, **account ID**, **environment**, or a [**tag**](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor). Selection parameters, once created, have a blue background.
* If you filter using a string, the filter will have the `=` operator.
* If you filter using the dropdown menu, once the first element of the searched item (tag key or attribute) is entered, you need to select an operator (`=`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `NOT_LIKE`, `IN`, `NOT IN`) for your filter.
* Once the operator is selected, complete the filter by selecting the value to complete the search item.

To add more filters, first you have to select an operator, `AND` or `OR.`

* Use `AND` to indicate you want to restrict the selection removing entities from the list of results. You can also use the AND operator to add conditions that need to be met in the list of results, for example, **entityType = Services `AND` location = APAC**.
  * Note that **entityType = Services `AND` entityType = Hosts** doesnâ€™t return any results, as entities can only have one type and no entity would match this condition.
* Use `OR` to add more entities to the selection. For example, the filter **entityType = Services `OR` entityType = Hosts** returns every entity you have access to that is of type `Services` or `Hosts`.

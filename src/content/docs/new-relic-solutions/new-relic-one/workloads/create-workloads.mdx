The entities you'll add to a workload will depend on your organization structure and goals. For example workloads, see [Workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster).

## Accounts and permissions [#accounts]

Before creating a workload, you should understand the difference between a  **workload account** and **scope accounts**.

These concepts will only be relevant if your [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure) has more than one account. For how to find an account's ID, see [Account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).

### The workload account [#workload-account]

The **workload account** is where data specific to that workload is stored. For example, a workload might generate [`NrAuditEvent` data](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples), and you'd find that data in the workload account. 

This account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can't be changed.

### Scope accounts [#scope-accounts]

The **scope accounts** are the accounts from which a workload fetches the telemetry data that makes up that workload. Users who don't have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see all the data in a workload. For team members who'll be using a workload, you should ensure you add all of them to the relevant accounts that workload pulls data from. 

Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.

## Create a workload [#create]

There are a few ways to create a workload.

### Create a workload in the UI [#create]

Here's how to create a workload from the workloads UI:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads**, and then click **+ Create a workload**.
2. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team.
3. From the **Select an account** dropdown, select the [workload account](#accounts) you'd like to use.
4. Click [Choose the scope accounts](#scope-accounts) to check all of the accounts this workload will use data from.
5. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload.

   * You can search by entity type, [tags](#tags), or [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region).
   * Click **+ Add this query** to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes.
   * Click **+ Add** next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes.
6. You can add both queries and specific entities to the workload, which work together according to the [query logic](#query-logic).
7. Click **Create a workload** to save it. 

If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can [set filters on those dashboard links](#filter-dashboards).

### Create workload in errors inbox [#errors]

To create a workload from errors inbox, see [Errors inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/getting-started/#global-workload).

### Create workload via API [#api]

To create a workload via our API, see the [NerdGraph workload tutorial](/docs/nerdgraph-workloads-tutorials). 

## Tips on defining workloads [#details]

Below are some details and tips about some aspects of defining workloads:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="tags"
    title="Use tags to define the workload content"
  >
    You can query and select workload entities using both [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) and [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute). Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the [tagging documentation](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="query-logic"
    title="How the dynamic query logic works"
  >
    You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload.

    * Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator.
    * Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator.
    * You can wrap strings between percent signs (`%`) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, `<team>-<env>-<appName>`), consider using [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, `team:awesome`, `env:production`).
    * We recommend not to use percent signs (`%`) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface.

  <Collapser
    id="add-dashboards"
    title="Add dashboards to workloads"
  >
If you have [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> from your workload.

To add <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> to a workload: After you've created a workload, go to the **Activity** page for a workload and click **Add dashboard**.

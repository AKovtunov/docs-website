To view your workloads, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** and click **Workloads**. 

Here's an explanation of the tabs in the workloads UI. 

## Health [#health]

The **Health** tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this:

<img
  title="Workload_health_tab"
  alt="Workload_health_tab"
  src={workloadsWorkloadHealthTab}
/>

It comprises the following:

1. The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve [used queries to dynamically select entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads/#query-logic), the workload entities will change over time.
2. The [workload status](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workload-status-views-notifications/) informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours.
3. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues.

## Activity [#activity]

The **Activity** tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this:

<img
  title="workloads_activity_tab.png"
  alt="workload_activity_tab.png"
  src={workloadsWorkloadsActivityTabLabeled}
/>

Here are the most important sections:

1. Linked dashboards. From the **Activity** tab, you can add related dashboards to your workloads, including links to pre-filtered dashboards. 
2. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial/#customize-golden-metrics).
3. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes.
4. External links. You can add external links to the code base, cloud services, or ticketing systems like jira. 


## Owner [#owner]

The **Owner** tab gives you information about the team responsible for the workload. It looks like this:

<img
  title="workloads_owner_tab.png"
  alt="workload_owner_tab.png"
  src={workloadsWorkloadsOwnerTab}
/>

It contains:

1. The team responsible for the workload. You can include more than one team.
2. The workload description. Share the mission of the workload, and the business logic it represents: Is it a web application? An API? A backend process? Fill in any details that are relevant to your team, or to other teams in your organization.
3. Contact information. From the drop-down menu, choose how your team prefers to be contacted.
4. Links to the most relevant resources to operate the workload. Here you can add links to runbooks, code repositories, productivity tools, or anything else related to the workload that you need at hand.

## Header [#header]

The **header** contains the filter bar and the edition controls:

1. Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload.
2. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from.
3. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health.
4. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account.

You can create workloads that update dynamically by leveraging tags. To learn how, watch this short video (approx. 3 minutes).

## View workloads maps [#maps]

You can view a topological map that displays how your workloads relate to and affect one another.

To access workloads maps:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Workloads** and select a workload.
2. Click **Map**.

To learn more about our omnimap-powered maps capabilities, see [Maps in context](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/maps-in-context). 

## Use the API [#api]

You can [query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API](/docs/nerdgraph-workloads-tutorials).

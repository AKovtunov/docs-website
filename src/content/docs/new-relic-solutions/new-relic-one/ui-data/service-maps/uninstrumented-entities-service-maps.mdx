New Relic can detect gaps on your instrumentation by analyzing your telemetry. These gaps can be databases, apps, or basically any other type of entity. For example, one application could be storing information in a non-instrumented Amazon RDS database. When that happens, you'll see in the form of an "uninstrumented" entity to reflect a gap of data in your instrumentation. You can check it in the [service map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps). You can also see the relationship between this uninstrumented entity and the instrumented one, which in this example is `mysql.demo.ep.rds.com`.

Uninstrumented and instrumented entities have different appearances. Uninstrumented entities have a dotted border, while instrumented entities have a solid border. To instrument an uninstrumented entity, click **Instrument** and follow the guided UI instructions for that type of entity. After you finish this process, the entity will have a solid border.

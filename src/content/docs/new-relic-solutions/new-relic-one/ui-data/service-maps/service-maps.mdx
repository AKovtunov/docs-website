Service maps are visual, dynamic representations of your architecture. Maps automatically show your app's connections and dependencies, including applications, databases, hosts, servers, and out-of-process services.

<Callout variant="tip">
  In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as [web external](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) or background external data.
</Callout>

Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture.

## Identify operational issues [#identify-issues]

Service maps are [color-coded](/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/service-maps-new-relic-one#alerts) to provide a quick look at the current status of your environment. Select nodes on a map to view additional performance metrics, and a full list and health check of each node's connections.

The map automatically connects nodes into the map, so you can see which apps on the map connect to others. This helps you troubleshoot and assess the impact of a performance problem between a calling application and a specific database.

With service maps, you can view your service and its status in the context of its up and downstream dependencies. Use maps to identify the root cause when troubleshooting an incident.

## Using service maps [#using-service-maps]

### Requirements [#requirements]

Service maps work with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps.

For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="dt-enabled"
    title="Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled"
  >
    The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are:

    * [Go agent 2.1.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes)
    * [Java agent 4.3.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
    * [.NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes)
    * [Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes)
    * [PHP agent 8.4 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes)
    * [Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes)
    * [Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="not-enabled"
    title="Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled"
  >
    The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are:

    * [Go 1.11 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes)
    * [Java 3.9.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
    * [.NET 4.2 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes)
    * [Node.js 2.0.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes)
    * [PHP 4.19.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes)
    * [Python 2.38.0.31 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes)
    * [Ruby 4.3.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes)
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### View entity-scoped service maps [#add-remove]

You can view service maps from different parts of **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar.

Each entity displays a color dependent on its performance.

* Green: there are currently no incidents for this entities performance.
* Yellow: there is an open warning incident for this entity.
* Red: there is an open critical incident for this entity.
* Gray: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for [databases or externals](#externals).
* Orange: anomalous behaviors.

### Explore service relationships with GraphQL APIs [#api]

You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with in our NerdGraph explorer, a tool to run GraphQL queries and mutations. To get started, see [NerdGraph tutorial: View entity data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/).

## Externals and databases in maps [#externals]

In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as [web external](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external) or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types:

* Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, **externals** are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported.
* **Databases** are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

## Troubleshoot missing nodes [#troubleshoot]

If you are unable to view certain entities in service maps, see [Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data](/docs/troubleshooting-missing-or-obfuscated-data-new-relic-one).

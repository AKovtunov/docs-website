## Problem

I'm not seeing some errors in the **Errors Inbox** page.

## Solution

The Browser Agent automatically collects unhandled errors as they bubble up to the page. If you know errors are occurring within your page or application but are not seeing them in the **Errors Inbox** page, it is most likely that those errors are being properly handled by your page or application. In such scenarios, you may want to utilize the [`noticeError` API](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/noticeerror).

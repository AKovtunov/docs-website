metaDescription: Change your browser agent type to Lite, Pro, or Pro+SPA
---

If you got started with the free version of New Relic and you're ready to optimize all our powerful browser monitoring features, you can upgrade your agent from Browser+Lite to Browser Pro or Browser+SPA. 

To change your browser edition type, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**.

Here are some comparisons between the different browser agent types to help you decide which one best fits your needs:

## Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA [#agent-types]

We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing.

      <td>
        This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring.

        What it includes:

        * Gives you access to all of the [Browser Pro features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features) and to [Single Page App (SPA) monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/introduction-single-page-app-monitoring/).
        * Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including [distributed tracing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing), for all types of applications.

          Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring.

## Pricing details

Check out these docs to learn more about pricing for each browser agent type:
* [Usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install.
* [Original pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent.

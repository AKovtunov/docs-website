Setting a proxy URL for the browser agent can be valuable because it can help you to get around ad blockers and security VPNs that block client requests to third-party domains.

Ad blockers and security VPNs often block third-party domains because they can be used to track users across the web. By proxying your requests through a first-party subdomain, you can bypass these blockers and ensure that your observability data is still being collected.

## How proxies work [#how-proxies-work]

From [version 1.240.0](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes) and higher, you can set up a proxy by configuring the following browser agent properties:
* `init.proxy.assets` determines where to fetch the browser agent.
  * If you’re using the copy/paste installation method, you’ll need to manually edit your JavaScript snippet and set `assets` to your domain URL. For example, if you’re using browser agent v1.240.0 Pro+SPA, and you set `init.proxy.assets` to `assets.mydomain.com`, the browser agent will be loaded from `https://assets.mydomain.com/nr-spa.<hash>-1.240.0.min.js` instead of `https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa.<hash>-1.240.0.min.js`.
  * If you’re using the NPM installation method, this configuration is not relevant. NPM-installed browser agents undergo the same bundling process as the host application and should result in agent assets in the `output` directory alongside the host application. When the host application is deployed, those agent assets should be deployed as well resulting in agent code already loading from the same domain as the site.
* `init.proxy.beacon` determines where analytics data gets sent.
  * For both installation methods, you’ll need to set `beacon` to your domain URL.
  * For example, if you set `beacon` to `beacon.mydomain.com`, all observability data will be sent to `https://beacon.mydomain.com/YOUR_NR_ENDPOINT`.

If you’re concerned about user privacy, you can exclude the `X-Forwarded-For HTTP` header, which is used to geolocate clients. If you exclude it, New Relic will geolocate your proxy as the client instead.

### Recommendations for proxy URLs

When configuring these properties, we recommend the following:

* Use a first-party subdomain. Even though you can technically use a third-party subdomain, it’s likely to get blocked by ad blockers and security VPNs.
* The subdomain URL pattern is `<domain>[:<port>][/<path>]`. Make sure to omit the protocol `https://` and ending URL slash. The `port` and `path` are optional and will be respected if added.
* If you’re configuring both `assets` and  `beacon`, set different values for each proxy URL, such as using a different subdomain for each URL or one that contains a different path. This will make configuring the proxy server a lot easier.

## Set up your proxy [#set-up]

To set up your proxy, see the instructions below based on which deployment method you used to install the browser agent.

### Copy/paste installation [#copy-paste]

If you're using the copy/paste installation method, add the following configuration to your browser JavaScript snippet, making sure to add your URL to `assets` and/or `beacon`:

```js
window.NREUM.init = {
    ...<other init properties>,
    proxy: {
        assets: URL
        beacon: URL
    }
}
```


### NPM installation [#npm]

If you’re using the NPM browser installation method, add the following configuration to your browser agent, which will pass the `beacon` field in the `init` object:

```js
new BrowserAgent({ init: { proxy: {
        beacon: <URL to send analytics>
    }
  }
})
```

## Using proxies [#using-proxies]

New Relic does not provide or support a cloud proxy service, so you must configure and manage your own proxy servers. To ensure full functionality, we make the following assumptions about your proxies:

* **Load the browser agent code from the New Relic CDN and pass it back to the client.** If you’re using the `assets` field, your proxy should load the browser agent code from `https://js-agent.newrelic.com/` and pass it back to the client. For example, for browser agent v1.240.0, requests to `https://assets.mydomain.com/nr-spa.3b61d78f-1.240.0.min.js` should yield the same response as from the upstream `https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa.3b61d78f-1.240.0.min.js`.
* **Forward client payloads to New Relic.** The `beacon` proxy forwards client payloads to New Relic. Your original endpoint can be found in your browser application settings page. Look for `;NREUM.info={beacon:"_____",...` in the JavaScript snippet. For most apps, this would be `(https://)bam.nr-data.net`. However, it could be different due to compliance and legal reasons. For example, requests to `https://yourproxy.com/1/asdf?a=123` should be passed through to `https://bam.nr-data.net/1/asdf?a=123`.
* **Do not modify requests and responses.** Requests and responses through the proxy server should not be modified.
* **Support the bandwidth and traffic generated by observability data collection.** Your system must be able to support proxying load, but the amount of data generated will depend on your site's usage.

metaDescription: "The agent can be configured to fetch its code and send analytics through a proxy server instead of New Relic's endpoints."

From [version 1.240.0](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes) and higher, the browser agent officially allows a proxy url to be set when determining either or both of:

1. Where to fetch or lazy-load agent code
2. Where to send observation data

Today, many ad-blockers and security VPNs block client requests to third-party domains including New Relic's. As the number of internet users opting into the use of ad-blockers increase, customers will continue to lose observability on those devices. One solution would be to proxy those requests though an unblocked middleman. For example, `yoursite.com` can send its user observability data through its `nrbeacon.yoursite.com` proxy which would not be blocked by ad-blockers being that it's considered a first-party (sub)domain.

## How to use a proxy [#use]

The agent utilizes two configuration properties when determining where to fetch agent code or send observability data.

For example, using copy-paste agent:

```js
window.NREUM.init = {
    ...<other init properties>,
    proxy: {
        assets: <URL to fetch agent chunks>,
        beacon: <URL to send analytics>
    }
}
```

For NPM, similarly just pass the `init` object with a proxy as part of any other configurations:

```js
new BrowserAgent({ init: { proxy: <object similar to above> } })
```

`init.proxy.assets` is used verbatim in the copy-paste installation to fetch agent code.

* For example, the v1.240.0 Pro+SPA loader will require `nr-spa.<hash>-1.240.min.js` file.
* If this field is set to `nrassets.abc.com``, the agent code will be loaded from `https://nrassets.abc.com/nr-spa.<hash>-1.240.0.min.js` instead of `https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa.<hash>-1.240.0.min.js`.

This configuration is not relevant to NPM installed agents. NPM installed agents will undergo the same bundling process as the host application and should result in agent assets in the output directory along side the host application. When the host application is deployed, those agent assets should be deployed as well resulting in agent code already loading from the same domain as the site.

`init.proxy.beacon` is used by both installation to allow proxying of observability data through a different domain. For example, if this field is set to `nrbeacon.abc.com`, all observability data will be sent to `https://nrbeacon.abc.com/<observability endpoint>` instead of what is configured automatically on the New Relic account and found in the `NREUM.info.beacon` configuration.

<Callout variant="important">
These configurations should follow a pattern of `<domain>[:<port>][/<path>]`. The protocol `https://` and ending slash **should be omitted**. The `port` and `path` are optional and will be respected.
</Callout>


<Callout variant="tip">
The browser agent team recommends using different values for each proxy configuration. This may mean each configuration is a different subdomain or possibly each contains a different path. This will make configuring the proxy server a lot easier.

## About your proxy server [#expectations]

The New Relic browser agent team provides neither a cloud proxy service nor support on such service application. **You must make and maintain your own proxy servers.**

To that effect, some assumptions are made about your proxy that must hold true for full functionality:

1. As mentioned above, if a proxy is used to load the agent code, it should fetch them from our CDN and pass it back to the client.
  a. Our current CDN is `https://js-agent.newrelic.com/`. E.g., for v1.240.0, requests to `https://yourproxy.com/nr-spa.3b61d78f-1.240.0.min.js` should yield the same response as from the upstream `https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa.3b61d78f-1.240.0.min.js`.
2. The beacon proxy forwards client payloads to New Relic.
  a. Your original endpoint can be found in your browser application settings page -- look for `;NREUM.info={beacon:"_____",...` in the copy snippet. For most apps, this would be `(https://)bam.nr-data.net`. However, it could be different for some customers for compliance and legal reasons.
  b. E.g., requests to `https://yourproxy.com/1/asdf?a=123` should be pass through to `https://bam.nr-data.net/1/asdf?a=123`.
3. Requests and responses through the proxy server should not be modified.
4. The client IP is passed in the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header from the proxy to New Relic servers. This is needed for the geolocation features in New Relic to work correctly.
  a. You can exclude this if user privacy is of concern. In the case that this field is missing, our geolocation will simply view your proxy's location as the "client".
5. Your system has the capability and capacity to handle the amount of bandwidth and traffic generated by observability data collection.
  a. This is entirely dependent upon the usage of your site.

When you're alerted about a new error, determining your next steps can be daunting. Once you see that a service triggered an alert, you may see that there are hundreds or thousands of error occurrences you might need to deal with. To add more complexity, just because a service triggered an alert doesn't necessarily mean the source of those errors is in that service.

New Relic is one resource that can help you broach high numbers of errors. This tutorial series guides you through unpacking the different causes for errors, as well as some tools at your disposal to triage and analyze your errors.

## Objectives [#objectives]

In this tutorial, you will:

* Determine whether an error is expected or unexpected
* Find the source of an error with logs in context
* Triage your error to the correct team

## Instrument your site [#instrument]

To get started, install the APM agent with our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=b3815b2d-8711-4418-335b-a9cac0468fe3). Our APM agent includes the logs in context feature that we will use in this tutorial. Logs in context does not require additional instrumentation. 

## Find the errors tab [#errors-inbox]

Let's say you've been notified that one of your services has gone down, and it's affecting a critical part of your customer funnel. When you check New Relic, you see that one of your services is alerting in the red, but there's also a lot of other data to look at. Your throughput might be up, or maybe there's an uptick in your error rate.

Keep in mind that when a service alerts you, it's only alerting you that a problem is affecting that particular service. The source of the error could be elsewhere. Think of it this way: you may see flooding at the side of your house near your hose and maybe that is the source of the problem. But maybe the issue is with your water main. If you assume that the flooding has to be related to the hose without further investigation, you risk wasting valuable time and money fixing a problem that doesn't exist. Worse, the crack in your water main that's causing the flooding could extend further up the line.

Once you're aware of the problem, you'll find yourself on that service's APM summary page. In this example, we're on the summary page for `API-gateway`. You may notice three things:

* Something about data
* Something about data
* Something about data

Your first step is to check the **Errors** tab under **Triage**.

## Analyze your errors [#analyze]

The errors page has two sections to begin analysis, both with the same information. The **Triage** section lets you assign errors to people or teams. The **Group errors** page gives you a waterfall view of individual errors that make up group errors. Either page summarizes the same data.

Your errors are categorized into two categories: expected or unexpected errors. At first glance, this might seem counter intuitive, but when you're reacting to an incident like a service outage, you want to focus on your unexpected errors. These kinds of errors are anomalous and may be due to a deployment or a dependency, rather than user error or a noncritical bug in your system. 

We recommend you take these steps when analyzing your errors:

1. Compare the different errors between the the error rate and error count graphs. Even with a high error count, if its count extends beyond the incident time frame, then you can assume it's an expected error. 
2. Adjust the time picker with a custom time frame when the initial spike in errors occurred.
3. Click the error group you want to focus on. This will bring up another page with details about logs, stack traces, distributed traces, and error attributes relating to the error occurrence.

While there's no hard and fast rule about which kind of data you use to troubleshoot, we do recommend you start with either stack traces or logs.

* If the error is on the code-level, a stack trace can point you to lines within your code that may be the source of the problem. For example [EXAMPLE HERE]
* Logs can give you an error description, such as a failed call to a dependency that triggered your service to alert. 

How you choose to troubleshoot an error depends on your familiarity with your app or services, the language your app is in, or whether or not you're in a distributed environment. Whatever the case, you can use this error summary page to sort through additional context so you can start resolving the issue. 

## Triage your error [#triage]

## What's next [#next]

This tutorial covered the first phase in addressing errors in your app. It guided you through how to identify a source error and triage that error to the correct teams. The next tutorial docs in this series will cover differentiating between direct cause and root cause and how to solve a high number of errors.

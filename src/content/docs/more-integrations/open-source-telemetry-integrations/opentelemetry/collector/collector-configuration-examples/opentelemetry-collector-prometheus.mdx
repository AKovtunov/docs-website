metaDescription: You can collect Prometheus metrics using the OpenTelemetry collector.
---
You can collect metrics from any [software that exposes Prometheus metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) with the OpenTelemetry collector by using the community [Prometheus receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver). The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

Complete the steps below to collect Prometheus metrics.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ## Ensure you have the prerequisites 

If you haven't already:

* [Sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup).
* Ensure that the Prometheus metrics endpoint is accessible to the OpenTelemetry collector as the collector uses the Prometheus receiver component. 
    * Prometheus metrics endpoint could be enabled by default or may need some additional configuration to enable it. 
    * Some software may require a [third-party Prometheus exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#third-party-exporters) to expose metrics.
* Finally, install the OpenTelemetry collector following the [Opentelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/). 

In some cases but not all, you may use an open source project that requires you to install the [OpenTelemetry contrib distro](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib). For example, if you use the Core distribution, the contrib distro contains additional components that the collector needs. Regardless of your distribution, you must have the [OTLP exporter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/otlpexporter) and the [Prometheus receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver) components installed. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ## Configure Opentelemetry collector

Update or create a new file called `config.yaml` and replace the following keys in the file with your own values:

* Prometheus scrape config:
    * `PROMETHEUS_JOBNAME`
    * `PROMETHEUS_HOSTNAME`  
    * `PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PORT`
    * `PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PATH`  (optional, default is /metrics)
* [New Relic License key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key):
	* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: "PROMETHEUS_JOBNAME"
          static_configs:
            - targets: [ "PROMETHEUS_HOSTNAME:PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PORT" ]
              labels:
                label_example: VALUE_EXAMPLE
          metrics_path: PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_PATH

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317
    headers:
      api-key: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
processors:
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch, memory_limiter]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

For further configuration options, please review:

* [Opentelemetry Collector docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).
* [Prometheus configuration docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/) for additional configuration details.
* [Scrape config doc](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config).

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ## Run the collector 

    Run the Opentelemetry collector. The way to run it may vary depending on the chosen installation method. For example:

```yaml
/usr/bin/otelcol --config ./config.yaml
```

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ## Find and use your data

You may use the [metrics explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer) to check the metrics being ingested. All metrics reported by the OTEL Prometheus receiver are detected by running the following query.

```sql
SELECT count(*) 
FROM Metric 
WHERE instrumentation.provider='opentelemetry' and otel.library.name='otelcol/prometheusreceiver' 
FACET metricName 
```

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting: metrics names don't match [#troubleshooting]

  Prometheus metrics based dashboards and entities use Prometheus metrics naming conventions to match the metrics being reported by the Prometheus endpoints. However, the OpenTelemetry Prometheus receiver uses OpenTelemetry naming conventions by default after [v076.3](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.76.3).

  To use Prometheus metrics naming conventions, disable the feature-gate `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` when running the OpenTelemetry collector:

  ```shell
  otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml --feature-gates=-pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName
  ```

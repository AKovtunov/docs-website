metaDescription: You can collect Kafka metrics from Confluent using the OpenTelemetry Collector.
---
You can collect metrics about your Confluent Cloud-managed Kafka deployment with the OpenTelemetry Collector. The collector is a component of OpenTelemetry that collects, processes, and exports telemetry data to New Relic (or any observability backend).

Complete the steps below to collect Kafka metrics from Confluent using an OpenTelemetry collector running in docker.

## Step 1: Sign up for New Relic! [#signup]

* If you haven't already done so, sign up for a free [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup).
* Get the <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />for the New Relic account to which you want to report data.

## Step 2: Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* You must have a docker daemon running
* You must have [Docker Compose](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/other-examples/collector/confluentcloud) installed
* You will need to generate a [TLS authentication key](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/encryption.html) from your [Confluent Cloud account](https://www.confluent.io/get-started/).  


## Step 3: Download or clone the examples repo [#example]

This setup uses the example collector configuration in [New Relic's OpenTelemetry Examples repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples).

Download the repo above, and navigate to the [Confluent Cloud example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/other-examples/collector/confluentcloud) directory. For more information, you can check the `README` there as well.

## Step 4: Add the pem key files and set variables [#configure-opentelemetry-collectors]

* Add the TLS authentication keys (key.pem, cert.pem, and ca.pem files) created in the pre-requisites into the `confluentcloud` directory.

* "Export the following variables or add them in a `.env` file, then run the `docker compose up` command."

```bash
export NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
export NEW_RELIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net
export CLUSTER_ID=<your_cluster_id>
export CLUSTER_API_KEY=<your_cluster_api_key>
export CLUSTER_API_SECRET=<your_cluster_api_secret>
export CLUSTER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<your_cluster_bootstrap_server>

docker compose up
```

* [Kafka Client API key](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/access-management/authenticate/api-keys/api-keys.html#resource-specific-api-keys)
	* CLUSTER_API_KEY
	* CLUSTER_API_SECRET
* [New Relic Ingest key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key)
	* NEW RELIC LICENSE KEY
* CLUSTER_ID
	* Cluster ID from Confluent cloud
	* Cluster key/secret should be specific to this cluster
* CLUSTER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER
  * bootstrap server provided by confluent for the cluster
  * example: xxx-xxxx.us-east-2.aws.confluent.cloud:9092


## Step 5: Set up dashboards in New Relic

Check out this New Relic [example dashboard](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-quickstarts/blob/main/dashboards/confluent-cloud/confluent-cloud.json) that uses these metrics:

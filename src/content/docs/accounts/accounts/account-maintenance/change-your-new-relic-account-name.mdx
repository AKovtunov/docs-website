## Change user name [#user-name]

To change your user name:
1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select **User preferences**.
2. On the right side, click **Full name**.

Note that if a user is managed via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), they can't change their name from the UI.  

## Change account name [#account-name]

Pro and Enterprise edition organizations can have more than one account.

To add and rename accounts: 

* From the [Access management UI](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/organization-detail), click **Accounts**. 
* For the account you want to rename, click `...` and then click **Edit account**.  

You can also use [our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/manage-accounts-nerdgraph). 

If you can't change an account name, it may be because: 

* You don't have required permissions
* You're on our original user model: in that case you'd use the **Account settings** UI, available from the user menu
* You have a partnership account structure: in that case, use [the Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object)

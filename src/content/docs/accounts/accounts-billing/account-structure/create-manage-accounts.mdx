Before you get started with New Relic, it's important to take a moment to think about how you want to use the data you're about to send to New Relic. Do you manage a parent organization with a few different subsidiary companies? Are you a small organization that's growing fast and you need to monitor your application at every stage of the development process?  You can easily customize New Relic to meet your organization's specific needs using accounts. 

With New Relic's account structure you can:

* Maximize data ingest
* Keep data organized 
* Monitor multiple environments, like staging and development
* Manage billing across different areas of your organization

This doc will guide you through setting up your account structure. Creating accounts is a good thing to do before you install our agents. It can be harder to make changes as you ingest data because you risk losing historical context.

If you're using Free or Standard editions, you only have one account available and you won't need this doc but feel free to revisit if you decide to change to Pro or Enterprise.

## Before you get started [#begin]

We're going to be talking about how to manage New Relic and we want to make sure you're familiar with our terms before we get started:

* **Organization**:  an organization represents a New Relic customer. Your New Relic organization contains everything relevant to you and your team members: your organization's accounts, users, and data.
* **Account**: When you sign up for New Relic your organization is automatically assigned one account. An account can have many sources of data reporting to it. For example, a single account could have data reporting from our infrastructure agent, an APM agent, and other integrations. All data reported to New Relic requires an account ID, which tells New Relic which account that data belongs in. That ID is also used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls.
* **User**: In your organization, your New Relic users are granted access to specific accounts that are relevant to their duties and responsibilities. To manage users' access to accounts, you grant groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that's a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts.

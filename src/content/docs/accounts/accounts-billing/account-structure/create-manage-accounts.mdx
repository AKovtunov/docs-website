Before you get started with New Relic, it's important to take a moment to think about how you want to use the data you're about to send to New Relic. Do you manage a parent organization with a few different subsidiary companies? Are you a small organization that's growing fast and you need to monitor your application at every stage of the development process?  You can easily customize New Relic to meet your organization's specific needs using accounts. 

With New Relic's account structure you can:

* Maximize data ingest
* Keep data organized 
* Monitor multiple environments, like staging and development
* Manage billing across different areas of your organization

This doc will guide you through setting up your account structure. Creating accounts is a good thing to do before you begin ingesting data. It can be harder to make changes after you connect New Relic to your applications because you risk losing historical context.

If you're using Free or Standard editions, you only have one account available and you won't need this doc but feel free to revisit if you decide to change to [Pro or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

## Before you get started [#begin]

In this guide we're going to help you create and manage your New Relic account. Before you get started we want to make sure you're familiar with our terms:

* **Organization**:  an organization represents a New Relic customer. Your New Relic organization contains everything relevant to you and your team members: your organization's accounts, users, and data.
* **Account**: When you sign up for New Relic your organization is automatically assigned one account. An account can have many sources of data reporting to it. For example, a single account could have data reporting from our infrastructure agent, an APM agent, and other integrations. All data reported to New Relic requires an account ID, which tells New Relic which account that data belongs in. That ID is also used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls.
* **User**: In your organization, your New Relic users are granted access to specific accounts that are relevant to their duties and responsibilities. To manage users' access to accounts, you grant groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that's a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts. Learn more about user management.

## What account structure is right for me? [#account-structure]

Signing up for New Relic automatically generates an organization. An organization contains one account unless you manually create more. One account can be perfect for many companies and it might not be necessary for you to add more. 

Some indications that one account is right for you:

* You have 200 employees or less and you don't anticipate growing too much
* You aren't ingesting vast amounts of data. If you're not sure, use [our spreadsheet](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost) to estimate the amount of data you might send to New Relic
* You expect to send a moderate amount of alerts. If you're not sure, review our [alerting rules and limits](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/rules-limits-alerts/)

If these don't apply to you, it might be good to consider a multiple account structure. 

### Use multiple accounts to separate testing and production environments [#environments]

If you create multiple accounts you can observe data across multiple environments. With multiple accounts, you can monitor changes before they go to production. If you’re updating your application weekly, or even daily, it is important that you have a strong testing environment in place so you can make sure each deployment is smooth and error free.

### Use multiple accounts to separate projects with unique data sets [#data-sets]

### Use multiple accounts to manage large data limits [#large-data-limits]

If you plan on ingesting vast amounts of data, it’s a good idea to create multiple accounts to avoid data limits. Financial institutions and healthcare providers often ingest high volumes of data because they track transactions and user information across multiple states and at high rates. Large retailers also benefit from creating multiple accounts. If you are a parent organization and you manage several, smaller companies, creating an account for each company could be a good idea.

### Use multiple accounts to manage security [#security]

Not everyone needs access to all of your data. Let’s say you’re a startup that relies heavily on contractors. You might not want temporary employees to have access to all your historical data. This would be a good opportunity to create multiple accounts.

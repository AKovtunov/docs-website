There are several ways a New Relic user can log into a New Relic organization: 

* Email and password: The default login method, which requires a user's email address and a password.
* Social login: You can use Google, Google Workplace, and GitHub to sign up for and log into New Relic. 
* Single sign-on: For identity provider login options, see [Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim). 

Having trouble logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/).

For managing how your users log in, see [Authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more).

## Billable user count is based on email address [#email]

In a [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure), user records that start with the same email address are considered the same user. For more about that, see [User management concepts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#user-record). 

## Switch between user records [#switch]

For users with access to more than one New Relic user record, see [Switch between users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/multiple-logins-found).

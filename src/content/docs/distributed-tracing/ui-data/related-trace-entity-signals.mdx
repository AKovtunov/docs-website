[Distributed tracing data](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#trace-structure) represents how the performance of entities across your distributed system impact each other.
Insights from this data are surfaced with respect to individual entities you view, showing when their performance might be impacted by other traced entities.

The Distributed trace insights component surfaces three types of performance signals from related traced entities.

* Call counts: Entities making a significantly increased number of calls through the entity you are viewing. This increase impacts the throughput on your entity.
* Exclusive duration: Entities called down to by the entity you are viewing, which are contributing significantly more latency. The latency contributed by an entity is the wall-clock time that it had one or more processes running but was **not** making any external or database calls.
* Error rates: Entities called down to by the entity you are viewing, which have more processes ending in errors.

This view is focused on helping you identify significant performance changes that might be impacting the entity you are viewing.
Traced entities are only listed if their impact on performance is relatively significant to the one you are viewing, and if that impact has increased with respect to the selected and previous time ranges.
To maintain this focus, other entities that participate in traces with the one you are viewing are not shown here if their performance impact is relatively consistent or smaller.

## Summary of trace Insights

This initial view shows you the number of traced entities that had significant performance impact and change, broken down by performance signal type as described above.
If no traced entities meet this condition for a given signal type, that signal is shown as green with a count of zero.
The non-green badge colors in this view are meant only to draw attention to signals of interest, and are not indicative of the health status of the entities listed.

When you click on a signal card, a list of entities is displayed with significant changes in performance impact for that signal.
If an entity meets this condition for multiple signals it will be listed under each of the respective cards.

## List of entities with significant performance impact and change


When you select a card from the initial view, you're shown a list of entities with a significant performance impact and change for the signal type you selected.

This should be updated to be a figure where each bullet correlates to a marker
Descriptions also need to be updated to remove upstream and downstream verbage.
Each item in the list shows:
* The name of the entity
* Entity health icon? (Did we actually add this?)
* Count: The number of traced calls to or from that entity, when it's in a call path with your entity.
* Duration: When the entity is upstream of yours, the average duration of calls it made where your entity was in the downstream call path. When the entity is downstream of yours, the average duration of calls made to the entity.
* Exclusive duration: When the entity is upstream of yours, the average exclusive duration of calls it made where your entity was in the downstream call path. When the entity is downstream of yours, the average exclusive duration of calls made to the entity.
* Error rate:
* Selected Signal icons:
* Percent change:
* Sparkline chart:
* View Trace button:

Lists have an initial limit of 20 entities; in the event that there are more than 20 entities with a significant performance impact a `Show More` button appears at the bottom of the list.

After you record a deployment for an APM application entity, through either the change tracking feature or the older [REST API](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/events/record-deployments/#api-instructions), you can notify your team members using a webhook.

## Get your webhook destination URL [#get-webhook-url]

You can send deployment data to a variety of webhook destinations. Follow the instructions for the tool you're using to get the webhook URL. If you want to use a Slack webhook, you must use the legacy New Relic Alerts app by following these steps:

1. Log in to your Slack account as an admin, and then go to **Apps**.
1. Search for **New Relic Alerts**, and click on that tile when it appears.
1. In the **New Relic Alerts** listing, click the **Configuration** button below the New Relic icon.
1. Click the **Configuration** tab below the heading **New Relic Alerts**.
1. On the **Configuration** tab, click the pencil icon.
1. Scroll down to the **Webhook URL** section, and click **Copy URL**.

Once you have the URL, complete the steps in the next section to configure webhook notifications.

## Configure webhook notifications for deployments [#configure-webhook]

You'll insert the webhook URL from above in the New Relic UI. You can reach the configuration screen for deployment webhook notifications by different paths, depending on your user model. To identify your user model, follow the instructions in the [introduction to user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models/).

1. Navigate to the deployment notifications configuration screen. This path depends on which New Relic user model you're on, which you can identify following the instructions here.
    * **Original user model:** Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > (user menu) > Account settings > Deploy notifications**.
    * **New user model:** Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > (user menu) > Administration > Integrations > Deploy notifications**.
1. Paste your webhook URL into the **Webhook URL** field and click **Save**.
1. Click **Send a test request** to send an example payload with artificial data to your webhook URL.
    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="A screenshot showing how to test the webhook"
      alt="A screenshot showing how to test the webhook"
      src={webHookTest}
    />
1. Under **Toggle this webhook**, you can disable or re-enable the webhook notification by clicking the switch.
1. To permanently delete the webhook notification configuration, click **Delete this webhook**.

## Notification payload structure [#payload-structure]

When your deployment notification is enabled and you create a deployment, your webhook will receive a POST request with a payload of type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by an `&`, with an `=` symbol between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values will be URL-encoded.

The following keys and values will be sent, based on the attributes of the deployment and of the APM application entity that was deployed.

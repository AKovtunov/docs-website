A good website â€” you know it when you see it, right? You never notice any load times, it's available whenever you need it, and, of course, errors are nowhere to be found. But _measuring_ your site's performance is tricky, and improving it is even trickier.

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to improve your site's experience. To get started, you'll start by "instrumenting" your site, which means adding some JavaScript code that measures the actual end-user experience for each visit. From there, you'll learn to find out how your site is performing today, where you can improve it, and how you can keep an eye on things in future.

## Instrument your site [#instrument]

Before you can improve your site's performance, you need the ability to see what's going on. New Relic monitoring always starts with an **integration**, or a piece of code that collects data from a relevant technology and reports it to New Relic. 

To monitor the frontend of your website, you'll want to use our **browser monitoring agent** integration. It's a small snippet of JavaScript that you'll include in your HTML `<head>`, very similar to Google Analytics or other scripts. 

There are two basic ways to install the browser monitoring agent:

        <TabsBarItem id="js-snippet">Copy-paste install</TabsBarItem>

    </TabsBar>

    <TabsPages>
        <TabsPageItem id="js-snippet">
            You can deploy the agent by itself by copy-pasting the JavaScript snippet into whatever part of your code generates the `<head>` for your webpage.

            If you're monitoring your backend with one of our APM agents, it can automatically inject the browser monitoring agent into the appropriate part of your webpage.

Diagnosing and resolving performance issues helps your organization attract new users while retaining existing ones. [According to Google's research](https://think.storage.googleapis.com/images/micromoments-guide-to-winning-shift-to-mobile-download.pdf), 29% of mobile users will avoid using a site or an application if it's too slow or too difficult to find information. Of that 29% of users, 70% leave because of site latency. 

While core web vitals capture how assets behave on your page from a user perspective, they're one part of resolving poor app performance. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial walks you through using New Relic to fix site latency. By the end of the tutorial, you'll have these tasks completed:

## Diagnose latency issues [#diagnostic-steps]

Latency measures how quickly a user receives a response when they make a request. Latency manifests through different page behaviors, so understanding the nuances between these behaviors can help you diagnose the cause and improve your site more efficiently. 

These are the most common causes of high latency:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="Slow page load"
    title="Slow page load"
  >
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures how quickly a web page renders its largest images, media, or text blocks. When a user experiences a page loading slower than expected, their wait time is measured in LCP. You can improve this form of latency by addressing LCP:

* Use Content Delivery Network (CDN). CDNs can adjust where content is being served from, or distribute them across 
* Optimize above-the-fold content.
* Evaluate your web hosting service.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="Page non-interactivity"
    title="Page non-interactivity"
  >
  **First input delay** (FID)  
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="Slow ajax"
    title="Slow AJAX requests"
  >
  When a user is feels that the overall performance of a site or application is poor, this is often the issue causing high latency. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as slow application times or long running JavaScript, but New Relic can help you find out if this is the issue your service is experiencing. AJAX monitoring is found on the **Ajax** page in <InlinePopover type="browser" />. For more information, see our [AJAX doc](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/ajax-page-identify-time-consuming-calls/#ajax-dashboard).

Once you know what the common causes of latency are and where to go to find them, you can use the **Summary** and **Ajax** pages in <InlinePopover type="browser" /> to find the cause of your high latency. You don't necessarily need to know how the services should perform overall, you only need to look for major recent changes in behavior. 

## An example of diagnosing high latency [#latency-example]

Once you're familiar with the common causes of latency, you can narrow down the specific issue that is impacting your site. Let's take a look at a service that is having issues with latency.

<img
  alt="A screenshot of the summary page with a poor LCP score"
  title="Abnormal LCP score"
  src={journeyAbnormalLCP}
/>

Here, you see the **Summary** page for a service showing a **Largest Contentful Paint** of 8.44 seconds. Since everything else falls under acceptable parameters, you can narrow down the cause of your latency as slow page load. You could select **Session trace** page for a specific view of what might be causing the issues with your LCP. This would be a good place to start a search to find what is causing your latency issues.

You could also select the **Largest Contentful Paint** section itself to go to the **Web vitals** page for a more generalized overview of errors based on page URLs, device type, browser type, and more. Once you find the source of the issue using this method, you can repair the problem and get your user experience back to the levels that keep your customers happy.

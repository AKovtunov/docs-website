So far we've covered the process of error analysis to respond to an outage. This kind of error analysis and resolution is what we call reactive monitoring: responding to a notification and using New Relic to find what needs to be immediately fixed. This doesn't mean you've found your root cause.  

Let's think about a house with a flooded yard. Your first indication a problem exists is the excess water by your hose bib, but if you assumed the flooding is caused by a leaking hose, you'd be making an expensive mistake. With some investigation, you'll eventually find that the cause of your flooded yard is a crack in your water main. That crack is your direct cause and you need to fix it ASAP, but it isn't your root cause. With a little more investigation, you might find that the oaks in your front yard have grown into your pipe upstream. You might have patched the crack, but to prevent future problems you'll need to remove the oaks in your front yard. Those oaks are your root cause.

The root cause of a problem is not the same as the direct cause of that problem. Likewise, fixing the direct cause (short term) does not usually mean you've fixed the root cause (long term) of the problem. It's very important to make this distinction.

When looking for a performance issue, you should first attempt to find the direct cause of the problem by asking the question, "What changed?". The component or behavior that changed is not usually the root cause but is in fact the direct cause that you need to resolve first. Resolving the root cause is important but usually requires a post-incident retroactive discussion and long-term problem management.

For example: service levels for your login capability suddenly drop. It's immediately found that traffic patterns are much higher than usual. You trace the performance issue to an open TCP connection limit configuration that's causing a much larger TCP connection queue. You immediately resolve the issue by deploying a TCP limit increase and some extra server instances. You solved the direct cause of the problem for the short term but the root cause could be anything from improper capacity planning, missed communication from marketing, or a related deployment with uninteded consequences on upstream loads.

This distinction is also made in ITIL/ITSM Incident management versus Problem management. Root causes are discussed in post-incident talks then resolved in longer-term problem management processes.

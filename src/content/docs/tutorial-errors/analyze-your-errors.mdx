Although we've identified a service that is closest to the problem, we haven't yet dug into the data available to you. Your errors inbox is one entry point into your entire system architecture. It gives you a filtered view of how your system is performing from the vantage point of error occurrences. 

To recap, we've identified via timeseries the error that brings you closer to resolving an outage. Now we need to investigate the error itself through the data at our disposal, like logs and traces. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc builds off the problem scoped from the [Scope the problem](/docs/tutorial-errors/scope-the-problem) doc of this tutorial series. In this doc, you will:

* Analyze your data 
* Identify what changed that caused a problem to occur  

## Examine errors with logs [#logs]

From the **Errors** summary page, you've already clicked the error that is the most likely to lead you to the source of your outage. New Relic has opened another page that displays attributes, logs, and traces about the error code. Below are two examples of working through the same error using two different methods, depending on the kinds of information your app sends to New Relic: 

It's likely you'll encounter a page that lacks full details when you're initially conducting error analysis. This can be because you've disabled distributed tracing, or maybe the nature of the error -- like a 500 error -- excludes stack trace details. At installation, your agent is able to collect some logging attributes about your application, but not all of them. Our biggest recommendations for APM is to set up your log forwarder to forward full log details to New Relic. This expedites the error analysis process.  

Looking at our example, our log forwarder has sent full log details to New Relic. This allows us to read denser descriptions about the nature of our error:

        alt="A screenshot showing an app with many errors"
        src={apmLogs}
    />

    <img
        title="Overview errors affecting your services"
        alt="A screenshot showing an app with many errors"
        src={apmLogsZoom}
    />    

</Side>
</SideBySide>

According to your logs, your problem is:

* A timeout error: `error.error.code: ETIMEDOUT`
* Related to your customer API: `error.endpoint: customers-api-internal`
* Agnostic to the kind of request sent to the customer API: `error.request: /api/customers/search/Kirlin/-/`

In other words, all calls to the customer API are timing out and, as a result, upstream requests from `api-gateway` are failing. 

At this point you've scoped out how a problem is affecting your customers, you know when the problem first occurred, and have found the source of your outage. Depending on your role, you can triage the error to the responsible team or begin fixing the problem in your system yourself. 

## Locate errors with stack traces [#traces]

When available, we recommend stack traces 
    <img
        title="Overview errors affecting your services"
        alt="A screenshot showing an app with many errors"
        src={apmStackTraces}
    />    

Varies by language. What you want to identify if you are able to capture an exception where there was something that was mistyped, if you have a long file with 50 lines. It'll be hard to go from top to the bottom to identify that. If you have a stack trace, it'll tell you where there was a problem in the process of running a problem. If you have something in line 50 that references a function in line 30, then you know to start looking at line 15. Maybe from there you're clued in to look at another function in line 106. Provides a short cut to zone in on a specific section of a file to check logic, typos, or other issues on a code-level. Can also tell you where in the code something occurred

I would know that this section "Template loader" belongs to a critical part of our code on our site, versus something like "Index" doesn't indicate too much what's critical. Depends on the familiarity of the developer with their own site and so on.

Although we've identified a service that is closest to the problem, we haven't yet dug into the data available to you. Your errors inbox is one entry point into your entire system architecture. It gives you a filtered view of how your system is performing from the vantage point of error occurrences.

To recap, we've identified via timeseries the error that brings you closer to resolving an outage. Now we need to investigate the error itself through the data at our disposal, like logs and traces. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc builds off the problem scoped from the [Scope the problem](/docs/tutorial-errors/scope-the-problem) doc of this tutorial series. In this doc, you will:

* Analyze your data 
* Identify what changed that caused a problem to occur  

## Conduct error analysis [#analysis]

From the **Errors** summary page, you've already clicked the error that is the most likely to lead you to the source of your outage. New Relic has opened another page that displays attributes, logs, and traces about the error code. Below are two examples of working through the same error using two different methods, depending on the kinds of information your app sends to New Relic: 

<Tabs>
	<TabsBar>
        <TabsBarItem id="1">
            Analyze with logs
        </TabsBarItem>
        <TabsBarItem id="2">
            Analyze with traces
        </TabsBarItem>
    </TabsBar>

    <TabsPages>
        <TabsPageItem id="1">

<img
title="Overview errors affecting your services"
alt="A screenshot showing an app with many errors"
src={apmErrorsAttributes}
/>

It's likely you'll encounter a page that lacks full details when you're initially conducting error analysis. This can be because you haven't enabled distributed tracing, or maybe the nature of the error -- like a 500 error -- excludes stack trace details. One of our biggest recommendations is to set up your log forwarder to forward full log details about your apps to New Relic.When you install an APM agent, the agent is able to collect some logging details about your application. Without log forwarding, these details are limited to certain attributes and can prolong the process of analyzing an error. 

In this example, our log forwarder has sent full log details to New Relic, allowing us to read denser descriptions about the nature of our error.

Your next step is to read.

        <TabsPageItem id="2">
            INSERT_TAB_CONTENT_HERE
        </TabsPageItem>
    </TabsPages>
</Tabs>

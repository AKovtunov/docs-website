Once you see that a service triggered an alert, you may see that there are hundreds or thousands of error occurrences you might need to deal with. To add more complexity, just because a service triggered an alert doesn't necessarily mean the source of those errors is in that service.

New Relic is one resource that can help you broach high numbers of errors. This tutorial series guides you through unpacking the different causes for errors, as well as some tools at your disposal to triage and analyze your errors.

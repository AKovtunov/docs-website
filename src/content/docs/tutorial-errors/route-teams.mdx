Now that you understand the full scope of your outage and the error group, you can assign the error and update its status. When you assign errors within New Relic, you can transfer all the information you've gathered to the code owners. Managing your errors inbox eliminates information silos across multiple teams, which expedites the resolution process. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial guides you through managing your errors so you can deploy fixes faster:

* Learn to assign errors to the correct teams
* Update the status of your errors

## Manage your error groups [#manage]

<Steps>
    <Step>

### Assign the error to the correct team
        
From the **Error group summary** page, you can assign the error group to the correct team. 

    <img
        title="Overview errors affecting your services"
        alt="A screenshot showing an app with many errors"
        src={apmTriageError}
    />  

Assigning an error to a person or team eliminates opportunities for miscommunications. The information that helped you solve the error is delivered directly to the code owner, allowing them to pick up where you left off. 

    </Step>
    <Step>

### Mark the status of the error 

Once assigned, you can update the status of an error. 

    <img
        title="Overview errors affecting your services"
        alt="A screenshot showing an app with many errors"
        src={apmErrorsStatus}
    />  

This functionality has a few different benefits:

* If an error group is expected, you can mark the error as **Ignored**. Expected errors are known to you and the team â€” they can be noncritical bugs, or they can be errors associated with the end user (like someone using an incorrect password). We recommend resolving expected errors as much as you can, however. Ignoring an error group doesn't prevent New Relic from reporting the error in the future, which contributes to your data ingest. 
* New Relic tracks the status of an error over time. For example, if you mark an error group as **Resolved** but it appears at a later point with a new deployment, New Relic will mark that error as a **Regression**.


    </Step>
    <Step>

### Investigate the root cause
        
Whether you're reducing common errors or reacting to a critical outage, you're following data that leads you to the direct cause of an error occurrence. You may have fixed the leaking pipe that flooded your yard, but you haven't yet figured out the why? behind the leaking pipe. 

Similar to a leaking pipe, when you're solving a problem that affects the end user, you aren't solving the root cause of an incident. The service that's not receiving API calls is a direct cause to a component failing, but the root of the problem can usually be found elsewhere. It could be poor planning for a new release or a lack of communication between two separate teams. These root causes won't be captured by an observability tool. Rather, they're uncovered in retrospectives and meetings between the people creating and improving a system.

Whatever the cause, until you've used incidents to discuss root causes, you'll continue to receive the same kinds of errors. Your app won't perform the way you want it to and the end user will have a poor experience.

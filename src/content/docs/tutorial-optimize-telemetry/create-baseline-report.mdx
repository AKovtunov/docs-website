Before you can optimize your data, it's necessary to get a high level view of all the telemetry your organization currently generates. To do this, you'll need to break down ingest data into various groups such as account, telemetry type, and application. Once you do, you'll be able to customize your report, download and install optional dashboards for further granularity, and optimize your telemetry so that you can understand exactly which groups within your organization are contributing which types and amount of data. 

This tutorial will cover how to generate a report that covers data based on the organization, accounts, and type of telemetry data. Once created, you'll learn how to create detailed breakdowns of the data based on application type, kubernetes cluster, and infrastructure integration.

## Install the data ingest governance baseline dashboard [#install-dash]

The data ingest governance baseline dashboard is the main view you use to establish baselines and monitor your ingest data. The **Overview** tab provides a variety of charts to help keep an eye on your ingest, and there are multiple tabs that provide detailed views of specific telemetry types such as browser data, APM data, logs, and traces. 

For generating the report you need to begin optimizing your telemetry, you need to use the **Baseline Reports** tab after you install the dashbaord using the steps below:  

To install the dashboard: 
1. Navigate to the [data ingest governance quickstart](https://onenr.io/0PoR8zpDYQG).
2. Click **Install this quickstart** in the upper right portion of your browser window.
3. Select your primary or top-level account in the account switcher, if applicable.
4. Click **Done**.
5. When the quickstart finishes installing, open the **Data ingest governance baseline** dashboard.

## Add ingest target indicators to your dashboard [#add-ingest]

Once you've set up the baseline dashboard, you should add target indicators to the dashboard to monitor. These indicators will help you in establishing your baselines and give you targets

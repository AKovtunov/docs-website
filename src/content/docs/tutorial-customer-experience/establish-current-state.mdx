### Review instrumented pages

Review browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to be reporting to New Relic is actually doing so. You can do this by reviewing the **Page Views** tab in the browser monitoring UI or running the following query:

```
SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX 
```

You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID.

### Validate browser URL grouping

Ensure browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the New Relic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL.

A segment is the text between two `/` in a URL or between `.` of a domain name. For example, in the URL `website.com/product/widget-name`, the segments are:
* `website`
* `.com`
* `product`
* `widget-name`

When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get abridged, so that `website.com/product/widget-name` becomes `website.com/` **or** `website.com/product/`. In this example, the first abridged URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product.

Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the [Segment allow-list investigation dashboard](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/browser-segment-investigation/eb24e234-90aa-4908-972d-64d6d56b557e) to help.

Once you've identified which segments to add, you can add them using [Segment allow-lists in browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/#adding).

### Understand how you will segment your data

Make customer experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in [segment allow lists](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/#adding).

Consider the following statements:
* Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay.
* On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint.
* Last week, there were 1 million page views.

Compared to:
* Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we're looking into this.
* Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it's 4 seconds.
* Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let's make sure we're optimizing our mobile experience.

Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="Region/Location"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
**Basic:** Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further.

**Advanced:** Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using [custom attributes](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/custom-events/report-browser-monitoring-custom-events-attributes/) in browser monitoring.

Facet by `countryCode`.

Related attributes:
* `regionCode`
* `city`
* `asnLatitude`
* `asnLongitude`
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Device"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand:

* Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users

* Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users

Facet by `deviceType`.

Related attributes:
* `userAgentName`
* `userAgentOS`
* `userAgentVersion`
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Product/line of business"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products:
* An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance
* A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels
* A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings

**Basic:** Break out performance by product by:
* Faceting on `pageUrl`: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic.
* Faceting by `appName`: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app.
* Grouping by `appName` and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product.

**Advanced:** Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using [custom attributes](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/custom-events/report-browser-monitoring-custom-events-attributes).
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Environment"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment for browser apps. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples:
* `account-management.prod`
* `hotels-book.prod`
* `car-insurance.uat`

Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for [how to rename browser apps](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/rename-browser-apps/).
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Team"
        title="INSERT_TITLE_HERE"
    >
In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the browser app name in New Relic (for example, `account-management.prod.unicorn-squad`) or by using [custom attributes](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/custom-events/report-browser-monitoring-custom-events-attributes).
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Import the quality foundation dashboard

<img

This step creates the dashboard that you'll use to measure your customer experience and improve it. To do this: 

1. Go to the [Quality foundation quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/customer-experience-quality-foundation/7a5739bf-30ee-4be9-9705-14871cafd7f4).
2. Follow the instructions in the quickstart to download the dashboard and customize it to fit how you plan to break out the data.
3. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it's most impactful.

### Capture current performance for each dashboard page

<img
  title="Capture current performance for each dashboard page"
  alt="Capture current performance for each dashboard page"

1. Follow the instructions on our [Quality foundation GitHub README](https://github.com/newrelic/oma-resource-center/tree/main/src/content/docs/oma/value-drivers/customer-experience/use-cases/quality-foundation).
2. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Examples of tracking-value: 
   * Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia.
   * Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US.

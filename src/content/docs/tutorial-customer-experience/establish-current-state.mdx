The first step in any improvement experience is to establish your baselines so that you have numbers to measure your KPIs against and can track improvement over time, and improving your customer experience is no exception to this rule. Once you check to make sure everything you need is reporting correctly to our platform, you can validate your information and use our quality foundation dashboard to measure your customer experience.

<Steps>
    <Step>
### Review instrumented pages

First, you'll need to review your browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report to New Relic is actually doing so. You can do this by reviewing the **Page Views** tab in the browser monitoring UI or running the following NRQL query:

```
SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX 
```

<Callout variant="tip">

    </Step>
    <Step>
### Validate browser URL grouping

After you've made sure that your instrumented pages report their data correctly, it's time to ensure browser segments are captured correctly. If you're unfamiliar with segments, they're simply the text between two `/`s in a URL or the `.`s of a domain name. For example, in the URL `website.com/product/widget-name`, the segments are:
* `website`
* `.com`
* `product`
* `widget-name`

When you have a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, you can abridge them so that `website.com/product/widget-name` becomes `website.com/` **or** `website.com/product/`. In this example, the first abridged URL isn't particularly useful, but the second one is a useful way of grouping customer experience data for the product.

<Callout variant="tip">
Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the [Segment allow-list investigation dashboard](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/browser-segment-investigation/eb24e234-90aa-4908-972d-64d6d56b557e) to help.

Once you've identified all your segments, use the [Segment allow-lists in browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/#adding) to add them.        
    </Step>
    <Step>
### Understand how you will segment your data

Now that you've validated your browser URL grouping, the next step is to make your customer experience data easier to understand by breaking it out into different segments. Unlike the previous step, segments here don't refer to sections of URLs (as in the [segment allow lists](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/#adding)), but instead refer to groups of data.

Often, segments can differentiate based on various factors. For example:
* Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay, while users in Malaysia and Indonesia experience 4 seconds.
* Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it's 4 seconds.
* In one week, there can be 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop.

Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into categories like those above to help find weak points in the overall experience. You usually group segments by the following categories:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="Region"
        title="Region and Location"
    >
**Basic:** Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there's nothing you need to do to break it out further.

**Advanced:** Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using [custom attributes](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/custom-events/report-browser-monitoring-custom-events-attributes/) in browser monitoring.

Facet by `countryCode`.

Related attributes:
* `regionCode`
* `city`
* `asnLatitude`
* `asnLongitude`
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Device"
        title="Device"
    >
Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand:

* Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users
* Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users

Facet by `deviceType`.

Related attributes:
* `userAgentName`
* `userAgentOS`
* `userAgentVersion`
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Product"
        title="Product or line of business"
    >
When a product is a separate line of business or service provided by an organization. Some examples of industries and respective products:

* An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance.
* A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels.
* A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings.

**Basic:** Break out performance by product by:
* Faceting on `pageUrl`: Use this approach when you group multiple products into one browser app in New Relic.
* Faceting by `appName`: Use this approach when you instrument each product as a separate web app.
* Grouping by `appName` and then facet: Use this approach when you hsbr multiple apps in browser supporting one product.

**Advanced:** Add product offerings as custom attributes to browser pages using [custom attributes](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/custom-events/report-browser-monitoring-custom-events-attributes).
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Environment"
        title="Environment"
    >
A naming convention that specifies the environment for browser apps during or after instrumentation . Well named browser apps specify products and/or functions as well as environment. Examples:
* `account-management.prod`
* `hotels-book.prod`
* `car-insurance.uat`

Use app naming conventions to note that the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see our docs for [how to rename browser apps](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/rename-browser-apps/).
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        id="Team"
        title="Team"
    >
In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the browser app name in New Relic (for example, `account-management.prod.unicorn-squad`) or by using [custom attributes](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/custom-events/report-browser-monitoring-custom-events-attributes).
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>        
    </Step>

### Import the quality foundation dashboard

<img
  title="Customer experience quality foundation dashboard"
  alt="Customer experience quality foundation dashboard"
  src={cxQfDashboard}

The next step is to create a dashboard that you'll use to measure and improve your customer experience against your baselines. To do this: 

1. Go to the [Quality foundation quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/customer-experience-quality-foundation/7a5739bf-30ee-4be9-9705-14871cafd7f4).
2. Follow the instructions in the quickstart to download the dashboard.
3. Customize it to fit how you plan to segment the data.

<Callout variant="tip">
Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it's most impactful.

    </Step>
    <Step>
### Capture current performance for each dashboard page

<img
  title="Capture current performance for each dashboard page"
  alt="Capture current performance for each dashboard page"
  src={cxQfKpiProgress}
/>
The last step in establishing your current state is to capture your current performance from the dashboard pages. To do this:

1. Follow the instructions on our [Quality foundation GitHub README](https://github.com/newrelic/oma-resource-center/tree/main/src/content/docs/oma/value-drivers/customer-experience/use-cases/quality-foundation).
2. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Examples of tracking-value: 
   * Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia.
   * Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US.

### Plan your work

Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint.

### Decide which KPIs to improve

You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? 
1. Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let's say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus your time initially.
2. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business.
3. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices.

### Improve targeted KPIs

To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it `Quality Foundation KPI Improvement`. For more information, see [Improve web uptime](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/customer-experience/cx-improve-web-uptime).

### Improve page load performance

Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren't meeting target KPI values.

For each page load KPI result that's out of bounds in the quality foundation dashboard, remove the `COMPARE WITH` clause and add `FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX` to find which pages are the poor performers.

Use `targetGroupedUrl` when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use `pageUrl`.

Original dashboard query:

```
FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO 
```

New query to identify problem pages:

```
FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX
```

Once you've identified pages to improve, see the guidance in [Improve page load performance](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/customer-experience/cx-improve-page-load).

### Improve AJAX response times

Find the slow requests using these steps:
1. Go to the AJAX duration widget on the dashboard.
2. View query, then open in query builder.
3. Add `facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX` to the end of the query.
4. Run the query.
5. View the results as a table and save to your KPI improvement dashboard as `LOB - AjaxResponseTimes`.
6. Focus improving requests with a `timeToSettle` \> 2.5s.

Use New Relic's recommended best practices to improve response times. See [AJAX troubleshooting tips](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/ajax-page-identify-time-consuming-calls/).

### Improve the AJAX error rate

Find the failing requests: 
1. Go to <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> > Query builder.
2. Enter and run the following query: 
    ```
    FROM AjaxRequest 
    SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) 
    WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter>
    SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName
    ```
3. View the results as a table and save to your KPI improvement dashboard as `LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors`.
4. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing:
    ```
    FROM AjaxRequest 
    SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) 
    WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=PROBLEMATIC_PAGE AND appName = YOUR_APP_NAME <Ajax Request filter> 
    SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl
    ```

Use New Relic's recommended best practices to improve response times. See [AJAX troubleshooting tips](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/ajax-page-identify-time-consuming-calls).

### Improve JavaScript errors

Find the most common failures: 
1. Go to <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> > Query builder
2. Enter and run the following query: 
    ```
    FROM JavaScriptError 
    SELECT count(errorClass) 
    SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter>  
    FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain
    ```
3. View the results as a table and save to your KPI improvement dashboard as `LOB - Javascript Errors`.
4. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed.
   Use New Relic's recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See [JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/javascript-errors-page-detect-analyze-errors/).
5. Remove third party errors that do not add value.

You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches:
* Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using [Anomaly NRQL](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-baseline-alert-conditions/) alerts.
* Drop the JavaScript error using [drop filters](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/drop-data-drop-filter-rules). Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter.

## Conclusion [#conclusion]

**Best practices to adopt:**
* Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as quality foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint.
* Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints.
* Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders.
* Define customer experience SLOs.
* Create alerts for [business critical drops](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/aqm-implementation-guide/) in quality foundation KPIs.

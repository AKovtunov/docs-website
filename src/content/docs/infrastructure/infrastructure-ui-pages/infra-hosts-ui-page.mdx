For our infrastructure monitoring UI, the **Hosts** UI page is the main place for you to understand and troubleshoot issues with your infrastructure. The host data is reported by your infrastructure agents.   [?? just from agent; is some data from cloud integrations? or on-host integrations?]

<Callout variant="tip">
  These docs describe the new **Hosts** UI added in June of 2023. In the UI, you can switch between this new view and the **Classic** view. The classic UI view will reach end-of-life in September of 2023.

## An example use case [#use-case]

The **Hosts** page is the place to go to investigate issues in your infrastructure. Here's one example of a common workflow our customers use to diagnose a problem: 

1. On the [APM summary page](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/triage-run-diagnostics), you notice an issue with your Kafka service. Throughput has dropped and many errors are present. 
2. Based on the infrastructure data you see in APM, you think it's a host issue so you click through to the infrastructure **Hosts** page. 
3. The **Hosts** page automatically filters to your Kafka service. You see that half of the hosts running that service have maxed out their CPU %. 

## Helpful UI features [#ui-features]

There are some important UI features available across the **Hosts** UI. Understanding how to use these will help you get the most out of this UI.

<img
  title="Infrastructure UI - Hosts UI options"
  alt="Infrastructure UI - Hosts UI options"
  src={infrastructureHostsUiOptions}
/>

* **A.** The filter bar: Filter for the hosts you want to see. For tips, see [Filter bar](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/search-filter-entities).
* **B.** Saved views: When you create a view you like (which can include filters, and custom chart and table selections), click **Save**. 
* **C.** Chart options: You can switch to different metrics for each chart, and you can click `...` to see [more chart options](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform/#data-analysis), including getting a shareable link and creating an alert for that metric. 
* **D.** Group by: Use this to group chart results by specific attributes. For example, you might display the AWS regions with the highest CPU usage grouped by `awsRegion`.
* **E.** Attribute filter: This lets you filter your hosts to those with a specific [attribute](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#attribute) value. For example, 
* **F.** Host table: 25 hosts are automatically selected for display in the charts above. You can use the table columns and the attribute filter to explore the hosts, and select different hosts for display.  
* **G.** Host details: For a specific host in the host table, click the `...` option to see more options to learn about it, including options for viewing logs, seeing an [entity map](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/automaps/), and more. 

## Host-related UI pages [#host-views]

We'll go into more detail about the host-related pages available on the **Hosts** UI page. 

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="summary"
    title="Summary"
    >

On the **Hosts** page, the **Summary** tab gives you an overview of your hosts' performance. 

<img

  alt="Hosts (New) Summary page"
  src={infrastructureHostsNewSummaryAnimated}
/>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>

The tiles at the top of this page give you an overview of your hosts, applications, events, and alerts. Use these tiles to see more detail about a host or filter the entire **Summary** page to a specific host.

Unlike the other **Hosts** tabs, the **Summary** page only shows you the last 80 minutes of data. To explore further back, use the other tabs on this page, or [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data).

    <Collapser
    id="system"
    title="System"
    >
    The **System** tab gives you an overview of your system. 

    In the **System** table, you can filter your hosts by metric name. With the <img src={infrastructureExportCSV} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Export CSV" title="Export CSV" /> button, you can export this table as a CSV file.

For our infrastructure monitoring UI, the **Hosts** UI page is the main place for you to understand and troubleshoot issues with your infrastructure. The host data is reported by your infrastructure agents.   [?? just from agent; is some data from cloud integrations? or on-host integrations?]

<Callout variant="tip">
  These docs describe the new **Hosts** UI added in June of 2023. In the UI, you can currently switch between this new view and the **Classic** view. The classic UI view will reach end-of-life in September, 2023.

Some details about the sections indicated in the screenshot: 

* **A**: Switch between the main **Overview** view to the [Navigator](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) and [Lookout](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-lookout-monitor-your-estate-glance) views. There's also a **Classic** view, which is the hosts UI view from before our June, 2023 change to this UI.
* **B**: The filter bar lets you filter for the hosts you want to examine. We have several recommended filters. 
* **C**: Here you can switch to the other [host-related views](#host-views), like **System** and **Network**.
* **D**: The **Metrics** section draws your attention to important metrics. 
* **E**: The charts on the host-related pages show data from 25 hosts, but you can manually adjust what hosts are shown. You can use the attribute search bar to find hosts.

## Host-related UI pages [#host-views]

We'll go into more detail about the host-related pages available on the **Hosts** UI page. 

First we'll explain some common features across all or most of the host-related tabs, and then we'll explain more details about each tab.

On the **Hosts** page, the **Summary** tab gives you an overview of your hosts' performance.

The tiles at the top of this page give you an overview of your hosts, applications, events, and alerts. Use these tiles to see more detail about a host or filter the entire **Summary** page to a specific host.

Unlike the other **Hosts** tabs, the **Summary** page only shows you the last 80 minutes of data. To explore further back, use the other tabs, or [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data).

    The **System** tab gives you an overview of your system. 

    In the **System** table, you can filter your hosts by metric name. With the <img src={infrastructureExportCSV} class="inline" style={{height: "30px", width: "30px"}} alt="Export CSV" title="Export CSV" /> button, you can export this table as a CSV file.

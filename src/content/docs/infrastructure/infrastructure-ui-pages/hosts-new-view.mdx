</figcaption>

Use the **Hosts** page and its tiles to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers and how they relate to one another. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems.

## Access the new infrastructure UI [#access-new-ui]

To view your hosts information, go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Hosts**, and click the **Overview** tab.

The new UI includes summary tiles that help you to see what's going on with your hosts at a high level, as well as to quickly drill-down to see specific host detail and filter by those hosts.

## Filters and saved views [#filter]

Use the filter at the top of the page to find your host by using the suggested filters, or by typing its name or tags attached to it.

If you have any saved views for Infrastructure, you can access them through the **Saved views** button.

## Hosts tabs [#tabs]

These are the available tabs in the **Hosts** page:

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
    id="summary"
    title="Summary"
    >
    
    The **Summary** tab gives you an overview of your hosts' performance.

    The four tiles at the top of the page give you a high-level overview of your hosts and their applications, events, and alerts. Use these tiles to see more detail about a host or filter your entire summary view by a specific host.

    ### Hosts
    
    The hosts tile shows you the total number of hosts in your account. Click to see a list of all your hosts. From that list, you search or browse for a specific host. Expand a specific host filter your view to that host or show more data.

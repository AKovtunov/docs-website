[New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) 
include an integration for sending your AWS CloudWatch Internet Monitor reported data to the New Relic platform. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it and what data can be reported.

## Features [#features]

You can collect and send telemetry data to New Relic from your [Internet Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html)
using our integration. Once integrated you can monitor your services, query incoming data, monitor logs and use readymade dashboard to observe everything at a glance.

Using New Relic integration with Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor, you can get metrics data and also can view cloudwatch logs that provides insights to metrics at granular level.

## Get Metrics Data [#get-metrics-data]

We have two options for reporting this data. The recommended path is setting up our [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream). Alternatively, you can use our [older Amazon integration that relies on polling](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/cloud-integrations/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations). 

## Get Logs Data [#get-logs-data]

Logs data can be reported to New Relic using [newrelic-log-ingestion](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs) lambda. Be sure to [add triggers] (/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs/#create-trigger) to the lambda and select the log group corresponding to internet-monitor at Country, City, Subdivision and Metro level.

## Find and use data [#find-use-data]

Metrics Data from this integration is attached to the `Metric` data type. To see your data: go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics and events** and filter by `aws.internetmonitor`.

## Tips on using your data [#use-data]

You can create alerts to notify you of any developing changes. For example, an alert can be set up to notify relevant parties of critical or fatal errors. [Learn more about creating alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts).

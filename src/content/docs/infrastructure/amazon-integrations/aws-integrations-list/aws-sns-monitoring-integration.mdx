[Our infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon Web Services Simple Notification Service (SNS) data to New Relic. 

## Features [#features]

[AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) is a managed push notification service. With New Relic's AWS SNS integration, data reported to New Relic includes:

* Messages sent and failed counts
* Subscriptions confirmed and deleted
* Additional [metrics](#metrics)

## Activate integration [#activate]

<Callout variant="important">
  To monitor all CloudWatch metrics from your AWS services, including custom namespaces, enable our [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-metric-stream). We no longer recommend using this polling-based integration.
</Callout>

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling [#polling]

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations). Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS SNS integration includes:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* AWS SNS data interval: 5 minutes

## Find and use data [#find-data]

To explore your [integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data):

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > AWS**.
2. Select any of the available SNS integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `QueueSample` [event type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data), with a `provider` value of `SnsTopic`.

## Metric data [#metrics]

This integration collects the following metrics. For full descriptions of some of these metrics, see [AWS's SNS metrics and dimensions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/sns-metricscollected.html).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Metrics indicated with an asterisk `*` are only fetched if [extended inventory collection](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations#extended) is on.
</Callout>

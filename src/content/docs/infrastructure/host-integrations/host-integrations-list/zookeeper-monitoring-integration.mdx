Our Apache ZooKeeper integration monitors the performance of your ZooKeeper clusters, helping you manage, and synchronize your distributed systems. Our Apache ZooKeeper integration gives you a pre-built dashboard that includes cluster-level and node-level metrics.

## Integrate Apache ZooKeeper with New Relic

Before bringing ZooKeeper data into New Relic, you'll need to follow [the infrastructure agent installation steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for the host containing your Apache ZooKeeper app.

You can integrate Apache Zookeeper with New Relic by using `NRI-ZooKeeper` for Apache ZooKeeper or NRI-Flex for Apache ZooKeeper.

## Use NRI-ZooKeeper to capture metrics
<Steps>

<Step>

### Install NRI-ZooKeeper

The New Relic infrastructure integration for ZooKeeper captures critical performance metrics reported by ZooKeeper nodes.

1. Download the [Zookeeper integration](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-zookeeper/releases).
2. Place the executable `nr-zookeeper` in `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/`.
3. Place the definition file `zookeeper-definition.yml` in `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations`.
4. Set execution permissions for the binary files nr-zookeeper. 

  ```bash
  ls -la /bin | grep nr
  ```
</Step>

<Step>

### Configure NRI-ZooKeeper for Apache Zookeeper:

1. Place the integration configuration file `zookeeper-config.yml.sample` in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d` and update its values.
2. Rename `zookeeper-config.yml.sample` as `zookeeper-config.yml`.
3. Open `zookeeper-config.yml` and update `PATH_OF_NC`.
4. You can use the following command to find the path of `nc` on the Linux OS.

   ```
    which nc
   ```

When finished, your `zookeeper-config.yml` file should look like this:

 ```yml
integration_name: com.newrelic.zookeeper
instances:
  - name: zookeeper
    command: metrics
    arguments:
      host: localhost
      port: 2181
      cmd: PATH_OF_NC
    labels:
      role: zookeeper
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Use NRI-Flex to capture metrics

<Steps>

<Step>
### Configure NRI-Flex for Apache ZooKeeper

Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent. To create a flex configuration file follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `zookeeper-config.yml` on the path below:
    * for Linux, `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`
    * for windows, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`
2. Using this [sample configuration file](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/examples/zookeeper-cmd-raw-example.yml) as a guide, modify your `zookeeper-config.yml` file.
   * Update the `EVENT_TYPE`, as the value in `event_type` can be used to store metrics in NRDB.

Once your configuration file is updated, it will look like this:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-flex
    # interval: 30s
    config:
      name: zookeeperFlex
      apis:
        - name: zookeeper
          event_type: EVENT_TYPE
          commands:
            - run: echo mntr | nc localhost 2181  ## change to your zookeeper server
              split_by: "\t"  ## split by tab
          snake_to_camel: true
          custom_attributes:
            myCustomAttr: theValue  ## inject your own additional custom attributes
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent 
Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
  ```

## Find your data

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Apache ZooKeeper` to monitor your Zookeeper application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the **+ Add data** page.
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `apache zookeeper`. 
4. The ZooKeeper dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your Apache ZooKeeper dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

When you use the `nri-zookeeper` integration your metrics will be exported into `ZookeeperSample`. Here is a NRQL query to check the number of znodes in the ZooKeeper namespace with a `nri-zookeeper` integration:

```sql
FROM ZookeeperSample 
SELECT latest(zk_znode_count)
```

When you use the `nri-flex` integration your metrics will be exported into the given `EVENT_TYPE`. Here is a NRQL query to check the number of znodes in the ZooKeeper namespace with a `nri-flex` integration:

```sql
FROM <EVENT_TYPE> 
SELECT latest(zkZnodeCount)
```

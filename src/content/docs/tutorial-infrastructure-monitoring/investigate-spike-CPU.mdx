You can use the infrastructure hosts pages to troubleshoot different incidents within your system. In the last doc, we discussed the benefits of fully instrumenting your system with recommendations from the guided install, then walked through a general example of how and why you might filter down to a set of hosts. This doc builds off that skill and walks you through how you might troubleshoot a real-world example.  

## Objectives [#objectives]

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

* Find the cause of an unexpected load spike
* Determine if resources are deprived because of a new deployment, or because of a job process

## Investigate a sudden spike in load [#spike-load]

Let's say your customer support notified you that a certain part of your site is down, namely the ability to complete purchase transactions. You may not have all the details, but two possibilities may come to mind:

* A new service deployment could be adding load to the servers or databases
* A redundant background job process could be causing the spike 

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Start with a filter set
        
Your system might have an excess of a thousand hosts, so you'll want to first filter down to a more specific set. Let's assume you have no additional context from an alert beyond what customer support relayed to you. You know that part of the site is down that covers purchase transactions, so you might start with the **Applications** tile to update your filter. There are five potential apps that could cause the site to go down.

    src={selectApps}

With app names added to your query, you've scoped your hundreds of hosts down to a set of three. The summary page now gives you an overview of how they're performing.

    src={appsSummaryTable}
/> 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Find a pattern across server behavior

Before choosing one or two hosts to scope out, we recommend identifying commonalities across the alerting hosts.

    title="Filter by the failing apps"
    alt="A screenshot displaying the app tile and filter bar."
    src={updatedSummary}
/> 

For example:

* We know that only three of your hosts have met an alert threshold, so it's not a scale event.
* The alerting hosts has a very high CPU, in excess of 90%.
* Disk utilization has also spiked beyond expected behavior. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Find the source of the incident

At this stage you're ready to go a layer deeper into your data.

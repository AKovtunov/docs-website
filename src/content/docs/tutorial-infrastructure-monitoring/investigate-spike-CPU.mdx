title: Investigate a spike in load
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure.
---

You can use the infrastructure hosts pages to troubleshoot different incidents within your system. In the last doc, we discussed the benefits of fully instrumenting your system with recommendations from the guided install, then walked through a general example of how and why you might filter down to a set of hosts. This doc builds off that skill and walks you through how you might troubleshoot a real-world example.  

Let's say your customer support has notified you that a certain part of your site is down, namely the ability to complete purchase transactions. You may not have all the details, but two possibilities come to mind:

* A new service deployment could be adding load to the servers or databases
* A background job process could be creating the spike 

Because you've instrumented your system, you have data reporting. But how do you find that data?

## Objectives [#objectives]

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

* Find the cause of an unexpected load spike
* Determine if resources are deprived because of a new deployment, or because of a job process
* Locate the deployment or process in your stack

## Investigate a sudden spike in load [#spike-load]

    ### Start with a filter set
        
Your system might have an excess of a thousand hosts, so you'll want to first filter down to a more specific set. Let's assume you have no additional context from an alert beyond what customer support has relayed to you. You know that part of the site is down that covers purchase transactions, so you might start with the **Applications** tile to update your filter. There are five potential apps that could cause the site to go down.

With your applications added, you've scoped your hundreds of hosts down to a set of six. From the summary table, you now have a high level overview of how they're performing.

    ### Find a pattern across server behavior

Before choose one or two hosts to scope out, we recommend you find commonalities across the alerting hosts. The metrics graphs can help you hone in on when a problem occurred, but the summary table can help you target the what.

For example:

* We see that only two of these hosts are alerting, so we know it's not a scale event.
* The alerting host has a very high CPU, in excess of 90%.
* Your disk utilization has also spiked beyond expected behavior. 
* When you adjust the time picker to zoom out to 12 hours, the metrics graphs pinpoint this to around 10 hours ago.

Before drilling deeper into the hosts themselves, update your query to only show data for those two hosts. The query should now have the following attributes:

```sql
AND "ip-172-20-56-208.us-west-1.compute.internal" OR "ip-172-20-59-246.us-west-1.compute.internal"
```

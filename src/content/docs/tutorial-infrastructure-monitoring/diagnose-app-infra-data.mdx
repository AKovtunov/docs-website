When your system is fully instrumented, you can correlate data between your system infrastructure and the apps your infrastructure supports. It's likely, though, that you have thousands of faceless hosts that allocate resources to those apps.

Let's say you're notified that certain apps are exhausting their resources. You don't know the names of your hosts and you're unfamiliar with what apps correspond to certain capabilities. How do you sort through all of your data to find infrastructure-related causes to failing apps?

## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc guides you through sorting through your host data within the infrastructure UI. You will:

* Filter your infrastructure data by attributes
* Use the timepicker to toggle your data to find when a change occurred 

## Explore your host data to find the cause of an outage [#explore]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Identify alerting hosts

    If you're uncertain about how to get started, we recommend initially scoping your hosts by alert severity. Using the summary page overview, you can see that there are three critical alert violations happening in your system.

    You can use the filter bar to filter through your hosts to view data only about those three critical alerts. In this case, your query would read `alertSeverity = 'CRITICAL'`, which scopes your aggregated data about 83 hosts down to just three. 

<img
    title="Your host summary page when you go to Infrastructure"
    alt="A screenshot displaying your host summary page"
    src={alertSummaryPage}
/> 

    If you haven't set up alerts yet, you can always sort the summary table by hosts metrics. For example, let's say that you have no indication that hosts are alerting but you've still been notified about a problem. 

<img
    title="Your host summary page when you go to Infrastructure"
    alt="A screenshot displaying your host summary page"
    src={tableSummaryPage}
/> 
    
    1. Click the name column on the summary table. You can sort by ascending or descending order. 
    2. In the screenshot, we sorted hosts by CPU usage, which placed  `host-tower-portland` at the top with 99.84% CPU. 
    3. Repeat the same process for memory usage, storage usage, and so on if needed. Repeat until you've found a pattern for anomolous behavior.
    4. When you have time, consider creating alerts for any critical thresholds. 
    
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Filter by app name

Once you've identified a host related to the incident, you can click through to view data only about that host. In this scenario, we've chosen `apache-svr01`. Since we're trying to solve an app-related issue, we're interested in the service map on the host's page. This identifies the apps that depend on your chosen host.

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Your host summary page when you go to Infrastructure"
    alt="A screenshot displaying your host summary page"
    src={serviceMapHosts}
/> 

From the `apache-svr01` scoped view, we can see that two apps depend on this host. One is alerting.

    </Side>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Your host summary page when you go to Infrastructure"
    alt="A screenshot displaying your host summary page"
    src={findApp}
/>

In this case, the app `Orders team` is the failing app.  
</Side>
</SideBySide>

Back on the infrastructure summary page, you can adjust the filter bar to show any hosts related to the `Orders team` app. 

<img
    title="Your host summary page when you go to Infrastructure"
    alt="A screenshot displaying your host summary page"
    src={filterApp}
/>

This filter widened the incident radius beyond your initial `apache_svr01` host, but still kept your data scoped to a relevant set. From here, you can start digging deeper into what resource limitation is affecting performance. 

Since only a couple of these hosts are alerting, you can rule out a potential database issue, which would affect all of the hosts. Instead, you might choose to dig deeper in the System, Network, Processes, Storage, or Docker containers tabs. 

    </Step>
        <Step>
    ### Adjust the time picker to find when a change first occurred

One additional action you can take to troubleshoot an incident is adjusting the time picker. This lets you view how your data has changed over time, so you can track when a change first occurred. Let's look at these metrics graphs toggled between 3 hours ago and 6 hours ago.

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 3 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics1}

/>    </Side>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 6 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics2}
/>    
</Side>
</SideBySide>

* Your time series at 3 hours doesn't display an obvious increase in disk utilization. Toggled to a 6 hour parameter, you can see approximately when behavior started to change. Your metrics graphs give you a visual clue when a spike or drop occurs. 
* If there's been an unexpected increase in load, the **Events** tile will display either many or too few expected events. 
* The **Alerts** tile displays the number of hosts that are currently alerting with critical or warning threshold. A steady increase in alerts over time might indicate when a change escalated certain unwanted behaviors.

The tiles and metrics graphs can help you triangulate the approximate time of an incident. This is especially helpful if the cause of an incident is due to a update from an external vendor, or a deployment from another team.

    </Step>

## What's next? [#next]

We've introduced how to locate failing apps by evaluating your infrastructure data. By starting with the summary page, you can overview how your hosts are performing over time and identify which hosts are supporting failing apps. But how do you use your infrastructure data to make a decision about resource allocation? 

The next doc covers how you can dig deeper on a more specific incident, like troubleshooting high CPU.

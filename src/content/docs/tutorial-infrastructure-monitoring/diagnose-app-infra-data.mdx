When your system is fully instrumented, you can correlate data between your system infrastructure and the apps your infrastructure supports. It's likely, then, you have thousands of faceless hosts that allocate resources to those apps.

Let's say you're notified that certain apps are exhausting their resources. You don't know the names of your hosts and you're unfamiliar with what apps correspond to certain capabilities. How do you sort through all of your data to find infrastructure-related causes to failing apps?

## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc guides you through sorting through your host data within the infrastructure UI. You will:

* Filter your infrastructure data by attributes
* Use the timepicker to toggle your data to find when a change occurred 

## Explore your host data [#explore]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Use the time picker to find when a change first occurred

The time picker lets you view historical data so you can track when a change first occurred. We recommend you take this step to help you whittle down where the cause of a certain incident lies. Let's look at these metrics graphs toggled between 3 hours ago and 6 hours ago.

<SideBySide>

    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics1}

    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 6 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics2}
/>    
</Side>
</SideBySide>

* Your time series at 3 hours doesn't display an obvious increase in disk utilization. Toggled to a 6 hour parameter, you can see approximately when behavior started to change. Your metrics graphs give you a visual clue when a spike or drop occurs. 
* If there's been an unexpected increase in load, the **Events** tile will display either many or too few expected events. 
* The **Alerts** tile displays the number of hosts that are currently alerting with critical or warning threshold. A steady increase in alerts over time would be expected as an incident is prolonged.

The tiles and metrics graphs can help you triangulate the approximate when of an incident. This is your first step for whittling down your hosts to a manageable number for troubleshooting. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Find the hosts that support the failing apps

The summary table displays the top 100 hosts from the last 80 minutes, sorted by alert severity. The summary table is static, so it won't change dynamically with the time picker.

According to our tiles, we have an unexpected number of events and four alerting hosts. An environment with upward to 1,000 hosts is a good use case to filter down to the specific set of hosts that are alerting.

<img
    title="Summary table displaying four alerting hosts and one warning host"
    alt="A screenshot displaying the summary table with alerting hosts."
    src={summaryTableAlerting}
/>  

Here are two examples of filtering down to a set of hosts based on attributes:  

* You can start with a simple filter for any hosts with alert severity critical: `alertSeverity = CRITICAL`. 
* Let's say you notice that these hosts support the same app. You can try filtering with `apmApplicationNames = Login Service` to compare performance across all hosts that support this app, regardless of their alert status. If something hasn't met an alert threshold yet, you can corroborate your findings against more data points. 

In general, we recommend filtering by certain attributes to help you define what set of hosts are associated with an incident. When in doubt, you can always start with our suggested filters as well.

## What's next? [#next]

We've introduced how to explore data in the infrastructure UI. By starting with the summary page, you can overview how your hosts are performing and start to dig deeper into your data. But how do you use your infrastructure data to make a decision about resource allocation? 

The next doc covers how you can dig deeper on a more specific incident, like troubleshooting high CPU and disk utilization.

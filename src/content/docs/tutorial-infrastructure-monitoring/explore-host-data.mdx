The performance of your infrastructure determines how well your APIs, services, and apps can make and respond to requests. A hardware failure can prevent your server from handling data, or maybe a memory leak brings an otherwise performant app to an abrupt halt. 

Like the bridges and roads of a dense city, your system infrastructure needs regular inspection and maintenance. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts? When you're able to observe your infrastructure in context, you can respond to incidents with more clarity and direction. Eventually, you'll be able to act before the incident even occurs.  

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial series focuses on monitoring your system infrastructure. By the end of the tutorial series, you will learn to:

* Analyze the data reported by our infrastructure agent
* Act on patterns you find in our UI
* Share your findings with other teams, like dev or sysadmin teams

## Explore your host data [#explore]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Install the infrastructure agent 

To install the infrastructure agent, we recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=a36f15a1-c5ce-528c-2ec2-8bcaacc40c03). Our guided install is a CLI installer that allows New Relic to inspect, then make recommendations about additional instrumentation to your system. For example, let's say you want to instrument your Apache hosts, which support these apps and services:

* A few Springboot apps running in JVMs
* Some microservices written in Ruby
* Some microservices written in Go 

In this case, the guided install would recommend:

* Our infrastructure agent for your Apache VMs
* The Java APM agent for your Springboot app
* Additional APM installs for your Ruby and Go microservices

You can choose to install the infrastructure agent only, or some combination of these recommendations. To get the most out of New Relic and this tutorial, we recommend you instrument anything you want to monitor.

While New Relic offers a full suite of tools and integrations to monitor Cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and other infra software, this tutorial is specific to data reported out of the box by our infra agent.
</Callout>
        
    </Step>
    <Step>

Once installed, you can find your infrastructure data in our UI. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure > Hosts](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**. You're now looking at a summary page about your instrumented hosts. 

<img
    title="Infrastructure UI hosts summary page"
    alt="A screenshot of the first page in the infrastructure UI when you go from All Capabilities to Infrastructure. It displays data about your hosts."
    src={hostSummaryPage}
/>

Each host page is separated into three sections: filter actions, metric graphs, and a table. The data represents changes in your golden metrics over time â€” that is, changes in host CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and disk utilization. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Toggle the time picker to adjust host metrics

You can toggle the time picker to adjust the scope of your data. This is best used when making comparisons across time, like if you want to understand when a change first occurred. 

Let's look at these metrics graphs toggled between 3 hours ago and 6 hours ago.

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 3 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics1}

/>    </Side>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 6 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics2}
/>    
</Side>
</SideBySide>

* If there's been an unexpected increase in load, the **Events** tile will display that behavior with either too many or too few expected events. When you compare between two time parameters, you can get a better sense of anomalous behavior.   
* The **Alerts** tile displays the number of hosts that have reached a critical or warning threshold. It can indicate whether you've found the parameter where an incident first appeared. 
* The timeseries in your metrics graphs can clue you into possible causes. For example, your time series at 3 hours might not display an obvious increase in disk utilization. Toggled to a 6 hour parameter, you can see approximately when behavior started to change.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Filter down to a set of hosts

Once you've confirmed the nature of an incident, you can look at the summary table to find failing hosts. The summary table displays the top 100 hosts from the last 80 minutes, sorted by alert severity. The summary table is static, so it won't change dynamically with the time picker. By focusing on hosts health from the last 80 minutes, you can continue to build the story around a failure. 

According to our tiles, we have an unexpected number of events and four alerting hosts. If you're looking at an environment with upward to 1,000 hosts, you'll want to filter down to the specific set that are failing. In this case, you might only be interested in the four alerting hosts, as they're likely responsible for the doubling of event data. 

<img
    title="Summary table displaying four alerting hosts and one warning host"
    alt="A screenshot displaying the summary table with alerting hosts."
    src={summaryTableAlerting}
/>  

Here are two examples of filtering down to a set of hosts based on attributes:  

* You can start with a simple filter for any hosts with alert severity critical: `alertSeverity = CRITICAL`. 
* Let's say you notice that these hosts belong to the same region. You can try filtering with `awsRegion = us-east1a` to compare performance across all hosts in that region. If something hasn't met an alert threshold yet, you can corroborate your findings against more data points. 

In general, we recommend filtering by certain attributes to help you define what set of hosts are associated with an incident. When in doubt, you can always start with our suggested filters as well. 

    </Step>
</Steps>

## What's next [#next]

We've introduced the kind of data you get out of the box with our infrastructure agent. You can get a high level understanding on how your system is performing with the summary page, but what if you're notified that something has failed and the system needs more resources? 

The next doc covers how you can troubleshoot a more specific incident, like high CPU and disk utilization.

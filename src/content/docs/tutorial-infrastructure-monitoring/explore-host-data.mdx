## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc guides you through these skills:

* Installing the infrastructure agent to get data about your whole system
* Filtering your infrastructure data by attributes

## Explore your host data [#explore]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Toggle the time picker to adjust host metrics

You can toggle the time picker to adjust the scope of your data. This is best used when making comparisons across time so you understand when a change first occurred. 

Let's look at these metrics graphs toggled between 3 hours ago and 6 hours ago.

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 3 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics1}

/>    </Side>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 6 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics2}
/>    
</Side>
</SideBySide>

* The timeseries in your metrics graphs can clue you into possible causes. For example, your time series at 3 hours might not display an obvious increase in disk utilization. Toggled to a 6 hour parameter, you can see approximately when behavior started to change.
* If there's been an unexpected increase in load, the **Events** tile will display that behavior with either too many or too few expected events. When you compare between two time parameters, you can get a better sense of anomalous behavior.   
* The **Alerts** tile displays the number of hosts that are currently alerting with critical or warning threshold.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Filter down to a set of hosts

We recommend that you explore the summary table to evaluate alerting hosts. The summary table displays the top 100 hosts from the last 80 minutes, sorted by alert severity. The summary table is static, so it won't change dynamically with the time picker.

According to our tiles, we have an unexpected number of events and four alerting hosts. An environment with upward to 1,000 hosts is a good use case to filter down to the specific set of hosts that are alerting.

<img
    title="Summary table displaying four alerting hosts and one warning host"
    alt="A screenshot displaying the summary table with alerting hosts."
    src={summaryTableAlerting}
/>  

Here are two examples of filtering down to a set of hosts based on attributes:  

* You can start with a simple filter for any hosts with alert severity critical: `alertSeverity = CRITICAL`. 
* Let's say you notice that these hosts support the same app. You can try filtering with `apmApplicationNames = Login Service` to compare performance across all hosts that support this app, regardless of their alert status. If something hasn't met an alert threshold yet, you can corroborate your findings against more data points. 

In general, we recommend filtering by certain attributes to help you define what set of hosts are associated with an incident. When in doubt, you can always start with our suggested filters as well.

## What's next? [#next]

We've introduced how to explore data in the infrastructure UI. By starting with the summary page, you can overview how your hosts are performing and start to dig deeper into your data. But how do you use your infrastructure data to make a decision about resource allocation? 

The next doc covers how you can dig deeper on a more specific incident, like troubleshooting high CPU and disk utilization.

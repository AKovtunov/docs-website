The performance of your infrastructure can affect how well your APIs, services, and apps can make and respond to requests. A hardware failure can prevent your server from handling data, or maybe a memory leak brings an otherwise performant app to an abrupt halt. 

Like the bridges and roads of a dense city, your system infrastructure needs regular inspection and maintenance. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts? How can New Relic help you make a decision about whether or not you should provision more resources? 

When you observe your infrastructure in context, you can respond to incidents with more clarity and direction, letting you move toward the goal of acting before an incident even occurs. By the end of this tutorial series, you'll know how to use New Relic to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation in your system.

## Objectives [#objectives]

This doc guides you through these skills:

* Installing the infrastructure agent to get data about your whole system
* Filtering your infrastructure data by attributes

## Explore your host data [#explore]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Install the infrastructure agent 

To install the infrastructure agent, we recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=a36f15a1-c5ce-528c-2ec2-8bcaacc40c03). Our guided install is a CLI installer that allows New Relic to inspect, then make recommendations about additional instrumentation to your system. For example, let's say you want to instrument your Linux hosts, which support these apps and services:

* A few Springboot apps running in JVMs
* Some microservices written in Ruby
* Some microservices written in Go 

In this case, the guided install would recommend:

* Our infrastructure agent for the hosts themselves
* The Java APM agent for your Springboot app
* Two additional APM agents for your Ruby and Go microservices

You can choose to install the infrastructure agent only, or some combination of these recommendations. To get the most out of New Relic and this tutorial, we recommend you instrument anything you want to monitor.

<Callout variant="important">
While New Relic offers a full suite of tools and integrations to monitor Cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and other infrastructure software, this tutorial is specific to data reported with an infrastructure agent that does not have additional integrations.
</Callout>
        
    </Step>
    <Step>

Once installed, you can find your infrastructure data in our UI. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**. You're now looking at a summary page about your instrumented hosts. 

<img
    title="Infrastructure UI hosts summary page"
    alt="A screenshot of the first page in the infrastructure UI when you go from All Capabilities to Infrastructure. It displays data about your hosts."
    src={hostSummaryPage}
/>

Each host page has a filter bar, metric graphs, and a summary table. The data represents changes in your golden metrics over time â€” that is, changes in host CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and disk utilization. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Toggle the time picker to adjust host metrics

You can toggle the time picker to adjust the scope of your data. This is best used when making comparisons across time so you understand when a change first occurred. 

Let's look at these metrics graphs toggled between 3 hours ago and 6 hours ago.

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 3 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics1}

/>    </Side>
    <Side>
<img
    title="Tiles and graphs set to a 6 hour time parameter"
    alt="A screenshot displaying two metrics graphs and tiles from the past 6 hours."
    src={metrics2}
/>    
</Side>
</SideBySide>

* The timeseries in your metrics graphs can clue you into possible causes. For example, your time series at 3 hours might not display an obvious increase in disk utilization. Toggled to a 6 hour parameter, you can see approximately when behavior started to change.
* If there's been an unexpected increase in load, the **Events** tile will display that behavior with either too many or too few expected events. When you compare between two time parameters, you can get a better sense of anomalous behavior.   
* The **Alerts** tile displays the number of hosts that are currently alerting with critical or warning threshold.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Filter down to a set of hosts

We recommend that you explore the summary table to evaluate alerting hosts. The summary table displays the top 100 hosts from the last 80 minutes, sorted by alert severity. The summary table is static, so it won't change dynamically with the time picker.

According to our tiles, we have an unexpected number of events and four alerting hosts. An environment with upward to 1,000 hosts is a good use case to filter down to the specific set of hosts that are alerting.

<img
    title="Summary table displaying four alerting hosts and one warning host"
    alt="A screenshot displaying the summary table with alerting hosts."
    src={summaryTableAlerting}
/>  

Here are two examples of filtering down to a set of hosts based on attributes:  

* You can start with a simple filter for any hosts with alert severity critical: `alertSeverity = CRITICAL`. 
* Let's say you notice that these hosts support the same app. You can try filtering with `apmApplicationNames = Login Service` to compare performance across all hosts that support this app, regardless of their alert status. If something hasn't met an alert threshold yet, you can corroborate your findings against more data points. 

In general, we recommend filtering by certain attributes to help you define what set of hosts are associated with an incident. When in doubt, you can always start with our suggested filters as well. 

    </Step>

## What's next? [#next]

We've introduced how to explore data in the infrastructure UI. By starting with the summary page, you can overview how your hosts are performing and start to dig deeper into your data. But how do you use your infrastructure data to make a decision about resource allocation? 

The next doc covers how you can dig deeper on a more specific incident, like troubleshooting high CPU and disk utilization.

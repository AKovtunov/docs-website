title: Explore your host data
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure. 
---

The performance of your infrastructure can affect how well your APIs, services, and apps can make and respond to requests. A hardware failure can prevent your server from handling data, or maybe a memory leak brings an otherwise performant app to an abrupt halt. 

Like the bridges and roads of a dense city, your system infrastructure needs regular inspection and maintenance. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts? How can New Relic help you make a decision about whether or not you should provision more resources? 

When you observe your infrastructure in context, you can respond to incidents with more clarity and direction, letting you move toward the goal of acting before an incident even occurs. By the end of this tutorial series, you'll know how to use New Relic to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation in your system.

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial series walks you through troubleshooting possible scenarios with your infrastructure data. The series begins with an explanation of how to install the infrastructure agent, which includes a breakdown of what comes with a typical installation. The remaining docs in the series are walkthroughs of possible scenarios where host data can help you resolve outages or anomalous behaviors.

    ### Install the infrastructure agent 

To install the infrastructure agent, we recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=a36f15a1-c5ce-528c-2ec2-8bcaacc40c03). Our guided install is a CLI installer that lets New Relic inspect, then make recommendations about additional instrumentation to your system.

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
For example, let's say you want to instrument your Linux hosts, which support these apps and services:

* A few Springboot apps running in JVMs
* Some microservices written in Ruby
* Some microservices written in Go 

    </Side>
    <Side>

In this case, the guided install would recommend:

* Our infrastructure agent for the hosts themselves
* The Java APM agent for your Springboot app
* Two additional APM agents for your Ruby and Go microservices
    </Side>
</SideBySide>

You can choose to install the infrastructure agent only, or some combination of these recommendations. To get the most out of New Relic and this tutorial, we recommend you instrument anything you want to monitor.

<Callout variant="important">
While New Relic offers a full suite of tools and integrations to monitor Cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and other infrastructure software, this tutorial is specific to data reported with an infrastructure agent that does not have additional integrations.

Once installed, you can find your infrastructure data in our UI. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**. You're now looking at a summary page about your instrumented hosts.

Each host page has a filter bar, metric graphs, and a summary table. The data represents changes in your golden metrics over time â€” that is, changes in host CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and disk utilization.

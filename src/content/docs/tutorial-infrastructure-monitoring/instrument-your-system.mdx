title: Collect data about your system infrastructure
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure. 
---

The performance of your infrastructure can affect the performance of your APIs, services, and apps. A database failure can prevent your server from handling data, or a memory leak brings an otherwise performant app to an abrupt halt. 

Like the bridges and roads of a dense city, your system infrastructure needs regular inspection and maintenance. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts? This tutorial walks you through how data ingested by New Relic can help you diagnose and make decisions about resource-related incidents.

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial series walks you through troubleshooting various scenarios using your infrastructure data. 

* The series begins with an explanation of how to install the infrastructure agent, which includes a breakdown of Cloud and on-host integrations. 
* The next doc shows you different actions you can take in the UI to find hosts that service a failing app.
* The third doc walks you through what "digging deeper" means with your infrastructure data.
* The final doc guides you through creating custom metrics dashboards with your infrastructure data.

When you observe your infrastructure in context, you can respond to incidents with more clarity and direction, letting you move toward the goal of acting before an incident even occurs. By the end of this tutorial series, you'll know how to use New Relic to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation in your system.

<Callout variant="important">
While New Relic offers a full suite of tools and integrations to monitor Cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and other infrastructure software, this tutorial is specific to data reported with an infrastructure agent that does not have additional integrations.

## Install the infrastructure agent  

<Steps>
<Step>
    ### Start with our guided install  

To install the infrastructure agent, we recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=a36f15a1-c5ce-528c-2ec2-8bcaacc40c03). Our guided install is a CLI installer that lets New Relic inspect, then make recommendations about additional instrumentation to your system. This includes an install for the infrastructure agent and additional installations if you have apps or services as well. 
        
    </Step>
    <Step>

### Instrument your system with agents

We recommend that you fully instrument your system when applicable. Fully instrumenting means you're installing an agent on any server, Cloud host, virtual machine, service, or app that makes up your system. When the guided install makes recommendations to you, it's letting you know that there's an agent available to capture data. 

Let's take an example of a system and what the guided install might recommend:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Your system uses...
            </th>
            <th>
                The guided install recommends...
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                A Windows, MacOS, or Linux operating system to run your hosts
            </td>
            <td>
                The infrastructure agent
            </td>
        </tr>
                <tr>
            <td>
                Java virtual machines 
            </td>
            <td>
                The JMX integration
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Azure virtual machines  
            </td>
            <td>
                The Microsoft Azure cloud integration 
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                A few Springboot apps
            </td>
            <td>
                The Java APM agent 
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Microservices written in Ruby and Go
            </td>
            <td>
                The Ruby agent **and** the Go APM agents
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The guided install, then, would recommend:

* The infrastructure agent with two additional integrations for Azure and Java virtual machines.
* The Java, Ruby, and Go agents for your apps.

The fidelity of your data largely depends on what you've chosen to report to New Relic. It's the difference between purchasing a point-and-shoot camera that may capture the essence of a scene without the detail, or a professional DSLR camera that brings a scene back to life. 

    </Step>
    <Step>

Once installed, you can find your infrastructure data in our UI. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**. You're now looking at a summary page about your instrumented hosts. 

<img
    title="Infrastructure UI hosts summary page"
    alt="A screenshot of the first page in the infrastructure UI when you go from All Capabilities to Infrastructure. It displays data about your hosts."
    src={hostSummaryPage}
/>

Each host page has a filter bar, metric graphs, and a summary table. The data represents changes in your golden metrics over time â€” that is, changes in host CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and disk utilization. 

    </Step>
    </Steps>

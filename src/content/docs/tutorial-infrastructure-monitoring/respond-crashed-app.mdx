The performance of your infrastructure determines how well your APIs, services, and apps can make and respond to requests. A hardware failure can prevent your server from handling data, or maybe a memory leak brings an otherwise performant app to an abrupt halt. 

Like the bridges and roads of a dense city, your system infrastructure needs regular inspection and maintenance. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts? When you're able to observe your infrastructure in context, you can respond to incidents with more clarity and direction. Eventually, you'll be able to act before the incident even occurs.  

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial series focuses on monitoring your system infrastructure. While New Relic offers a full suite of tools and integrations to monitor Cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and other infra software, this tutorial is specific to data reported out of the box by our infra agent. By the end of the tutorial series, you will learn to:

* Analyze the data reported by our infrastructure agent
* Act on patterns you find in our UI
* Share your findings with other teams, like dev or sysadmin teams

## Explore your host data [#explore]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Install the infrastructure agent 

[GUIDED INSTALL LINK]

When you use our guided install, the infrastructure agent inspects your system and makes recommendations about instrumentation. Instrumenting means assigning an agent to the different parts of your stack, letting New Relic capture and store data about your system's behavior. 

For example, let's say that you run:

* A dozen Apache virtual hosts that support many services
* One Springboot app running in a JVM
* [EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER APM AGENT THAT NEEDS SEPARATE APM INSTALL]
* Fluentd to capture your logs

In this case, the guided install would recommend our infrastructure agent, Java APM agent, and our Fluentd log forwarding integration. You can choose to just install the infra agent, or some combination of these recommendations. To get the most out of New Relic and this tutorial, we recommend you instrument anything you want to monitor.

    ### Toggle the time picker to adjust host metrics

Once installed, you can find your infrastructure data at **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure > Hosts](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**.

Host pages are separated into three sections: filter actions, metric graphs, and a table. The data represents changes in your golden metrics over time â€” that is, changes in host CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and disk utilization.

* Toggle the time picker to compare data from 3 hours ago against 30 minutes ago. The number of events that have occurred will update in the score card, letting you see an uptick in event data over a given time period.         
* Determine when an entity -- that is, an active host -- as begun alerting in the alert tile.

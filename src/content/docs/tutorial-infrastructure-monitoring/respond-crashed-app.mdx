title: Respond to a crashed app
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure. 
---


The performance of your infrastructure determines how well your APIs, services, and apps can make and respond to requests. A hardware failure can prevent your server from handling data, or maybe a memory leak brings an otherwise performant app to an abrupt halt. 

Like the bridges and roads of a dense city, your system infrastructure needs regular inspection and maintenance. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts? When you're able to observe your infrastructure in context, you can respond to incidents with more clarity and direction. Eventually, you'll be able to act before the incident even occurs.  

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial series focuses on monitoring your system infrastructure. While New Relic offers a full suite of tools and integrations to monitor Cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and other infra software, this tutorial is specific to data reported out of the box by our infra agent. By the end of the tutorial series, you will learn to:

* Analyze the data reported by our infrastructure agent
* Act on patterns you find in our UI
* Share your findings with other teams, like dev or sysadmin teams

## Explore your host data [#explore]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Install the infrastructure agent 

To install the infrastructure agent, we recommend using our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=a36f15a1-c5ce-528c-2ec2-8bcaacc40c03). 

When you use the guided install, you'll run a command that allows New Relic to make recommendations about additional instrumentation.

For example, let's say you're installing our infra agent to your Apache hosts, which support these apps and services:

* A few Springboot apps running in JVMs
* Some microservices written in Ruby
* A couple more microservices written in Go
* Fluentd to capture your logs

In this case, the guided install would recommend:

* Our infrastructure agent for your Apache VMs
* The Java APM agent for your Springboot app
* Additional APM installs for your Ruby and Go microservices
* Our log forwarding integration to look at your logs 

You can choose to just install the infra agent, or some combination of these recommendations. To get the most out of New Relic and this tutorial, we recommend you instrument anything you want to monitor.

    <Step>

Once installed, you can find your infrastructure data in our UI. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure > Hosts](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**. You're now looking at summary data based on golden metrics of all your hosts. 

Each host page is separated into three sections: filter actions, metric graphs, and a table. The data represents changes in your golden metrics over time â€” that is, changes in host CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and disk utilization. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Toggle the time picker to adjust host metrics

You can toggle the time picker to adjust the scope of your data. This is best used when making comparisons across time, like if you want to understand when a change first occurred. 

Let's look at two screenshots of the same hosts page but toggled to 1 hour ago and 12 hours ago.

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
        LEFT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
    <Side>
        RIGHT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
</SideBySide>

* If there's been an unexpected increase in load, the **Events** tile will display that behavior with either too many or too few expected events.    
* If an incident occurred in the last 30 minutes, the **Alerts** tile will display the number of hosts that have reached a critical or warning threshold.
* The timeseries in your metrics graphs can clue you into possible causes. For example, your time series at 30 minutes might not display an obvious increase in disk utilization. Toggled to a 3 hour parameter, you can see indications of a potential memory leak. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Filter down to a set of Hosts

The summary table displays the top 100 hosts from the last 80 minutes, sorted by alert severity. In the last step, we identified `host-tower-boston` as ground zero for a significant change in behavior, so you'll see `host-tower-boston` at the top of the table. 

In addition to `host-tower-boston`, you can see that `apache-svr-2` is also alerting. You know that both share certain attributes, so you want to confirm whether or not other hosts with those shared attributes are exhibiting similar behavior. You can use the filter bar at the top of the page to sort down to those specific hosts. 

For example: `host-tower-boston` and `apache-svr-2` share an AWS region and service the same app. You can filter the summary page down to only show hosts that are in that same AWS region or service that particular app. This might look something like this: `awsRegion = us-east-1a AND apmApplicationNames = Proxy-East`. 

Note that the time picker does not adjust the hosts listed in the table.

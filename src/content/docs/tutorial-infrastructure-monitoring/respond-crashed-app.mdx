title: Respond to a crashed app
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure.

Your system infrastructure can enable and prevent [ELEPHANT] of your APIs, services, and apps. A hardware failure stops your server from performing actions, or maybe a memory leak brings your app to an abrupt halt. The infrastructure of a complex system is similar to the infrastructure of a dense city: like your hosts, servers, and cloud environments, a city's infrastructure [something something something].

To maintain your infrastructure, you need to be be able to see your infrastructure in context. What processes affect CPU and disk usage? What app behaviors typically correlate with failing hosts?

## Objectives [#objectives]

## Install the infrastructure agent [#install]

The infrastructure agent assumes the role of a city inspector who can report data about your infrastructure health to New Relic. When you begin installation with our guided install, the agent takes inventory of your architecture, then makes a series recommendations to instrument your stack. 

For example, let's say this makes up someone's stack:

* A dozen Apache virtual hosts that support many services
* Two separate Springboot apps running in their own, separate JVM 
* Using Fluentd to capture your logs

When you follow our guided install for the infrastructure agent, it'll collect data about your architecture, then make recommendations about what  else you should instrument. In this case, the guided install would recommend you instrument with our infrastructure, Java, and Ruby agents, as well as our Fluentd log forwarding integration.

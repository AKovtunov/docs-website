metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure.

Now that you've identified the cause of an incident, you'll want to establish a line of communication between your team and external teams. For example, while the source of the incident was a redundant process found in a host, it had a downstream effect on the app ELEPHANT. Since this app is critical, you can create a saved view to share with dev teams.

        ### Decide on a filter query

For a saved view to be effective, you want to set up a query that scopes a set of data to the thing you want to target. For example:

* You can create a view scoped to a particular customer journey, like the apps responsible for making purchase transactions. 
* You may want to track all your Ruby or Java processes that occur in different environments.
* You could create a view that displays infrastructure data relevant to discrete teams across your org.

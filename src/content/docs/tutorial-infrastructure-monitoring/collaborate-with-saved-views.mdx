Now that you've identified the cause of an incident, you'll want to establish a line of communication between your team and external teams. For example, while the source of the incident was a redundant process found in a host, it had a downstream effect on the app `Order-Processing`. While you may not own this app, it's critical to your dev teams and important to customers.  

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Save a host view scoped to a particular set of apps
* Create a dashboard based on the dimensional metrics specific to a host process 

## Collaborate across teams [#collaborate]

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Save a view

<img
    title="Infrastructure UI hosts summary page"
    alt="A screenshot of the first page in the infrastructure UI when you go from All Capabilities to Infrastructure. It displays data about your hosts."
    src={saveView}
/>

For a saved view to be effective, you want to set up a query that scopes a set of data to the thing you want to target. For example:

* You can create a view scoped to a particular customer journey, like the apps responsible for making purchase transactions. 
* You may want to track all your Ruby or Java processes that occur in different environments.
* You could create a view that displays infrastructure data relevant to discrete teams across your org. 

Once you've decided, click the **Save** button. When you go to the infrastructure hosts page, you can pull up any view pre-scoped to a team or set of hosts.

title: Make dashboards for metric storytelling 
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure. 
---

Creating stories with your data can better organize a team and help you resolve trickier incidents. Maybe you've encountered a behavior that isn't widespread, but affects certain parts of your system at certain times. Alternatively, maybe you want to view certain kinds of metrics together to build a more cohesive narrative about your system. 

Dashboards are a storytelling device that let you control how your data is viewed for a particular audience. If a team is tasked with solving anomalous behavior, you can create a dashboard that's specific to those team's needs. But how can you go about building custom dashboards with your existing data? 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial shows you different options to present infrastructure metrics via our dashboards. You will:

* Learn how to install prebuilt dashboards
* See how widgets are created with NRQL queries
* Add a new metrics query from the Metrics Explorer

## Add custom dashboards to your New Relic account [#add]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Install a custom dashboard 

You can explore different kinds of prebuilt dashboards:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Dashboards](https://one.newrelic.com/dashboards)**. 
2. Click **View all**.
3. Search for **Infrastructure & OS**.

IMAGE HERE.

While we have many prebuilt dashboards to choose from, if you're new to our dashboards, we recommend that you start with our Infrastructure Dashboard. This dashboard takes your host metrics and places them in context of other hosts. 

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
        LEFT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
    <Side>
        RIGHT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
</SideBySide>

This re-contextualization of your data can help you establish baselines for behavior, decide what kinds of alerts you need from those behaviors, and better identify ordinary behavior from anomolous behavior. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Use NRQL to create a widget for your dashboard 

Each widget within a custom dashboard is made up of NRQL queries. Like a SQL query, NRQL is designed to let you control and manage data stored in our database so you can present your data to meet your individual needs. Let's explore how you might create a widget to build a particular data story.

1. **Identify the problem you want to solve.** For example, you have certain processes that are consistently high resource consumers, but these processes are distributed across different hosts. 
2. **Experiment with NRQL.** You need to decide the best format for presenting this data visually. NRQL lets you create line graphs, tables, pie charts, or time series. Here's an example of how two NRQL queries create two different charts:

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
        LEFT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
    <Side>
        RIGHT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
</SideBySide>

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
        LEFT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
    <Side>
        RIGHT_SIDE_CONTENT
    </Side>
</SideBySide>

3. View an existing query to create new widgets for your story. You can do this by clicking the ellipses on a graph you want to mimic and selecting **View query**. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Add metrics from the Metrics Explorer

You can find specific metrics you might want to add to a dashboard via our **Metrics explorer**. There are a few different ways to access the explorer that depend on what you need. To view all metrics for all your data sources, go to **[one.newrelic.com > Metrics & Events](https://one.newrelic.com/data-explorer)**.

If you're just getting started, we recommend you add metrics from an individual source. For example, let's say you want a widget about a specific host that often exceeds a CPU threshold:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**, then find your host.
2. Open the host-scoped summary page.
3. Click **Metrics explorer**. Choose the metric and dimensions you want the graph to represent. For our purposes, we've chosen `host.process.threadCount` and have grouped it by `apmApplicationNames`. 
4. Click the ellipses and select **Add to dashboard**.

This is good practice if you're using a prebuilt dashboard as a template, but want to add additional charts to it. 

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Observe your data

Once you've designed and shared your dashboard, it's time to observe your data. Dashboards have as many use cases as there are stories you want to tell. We recommend using them for these use cases:

* Establishing patterns between data sources to correlate a root causes 
* Sharing data across separate teams
* Scoping data to squads assigned specific tasks

To explore our existing prebuilt dashboards, we recommend starting with our [instant observability page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability).

## What's next? [#next]

In this tutorial series you learned about:

* The guided install process for the infrastructure agent and how New Relic captures data about your system
* Identifying failing hosts and apps using only infrastructure metrics
* Going deeper with your data to interpret infrastructure behavior to resolve an outages
* Dashboards that tell different stories with your data

With these skills, we recommend you go deeper with your data:

* Do you want to learn how to monitor Kubernetes? Check out our [Kubernetes tutorial](docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-new-relic-alerts).
* Do you want to improve the quality of your alerts? Our [alerts tutorial](docs/tutorial-create-alerts/create-new-relic-alerts) teaches you the anatomy of an alert so you can build a better alerting strategy.

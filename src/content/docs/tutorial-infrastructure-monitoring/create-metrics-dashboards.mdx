title: Build custom dashboards to troubleshoot recurring incidents
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure.

You might encounter anomalous behavior that isn't widespread, but affects certain parts of your system. Maybe behavior changes once a week on a consistent cadence, then resolves itself just as reliably. Your data doesn't indicate any definitive deployment, upgrade, or redundant process, so you're not sure what the cause is or what to recommend. 

In this case, you can use infrastructure data to create a custom dashboard to help you correlate a cause. This process lets you take data collected by the infrastructure agent and build a narrative around the incident. With cases like this, you check your dashboard over an extended period of time, like several days or a few weeks, until a causal pattern reveals itself. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial shows you how to create a custom dashboard based on host metrics. 

## Create a custom dashboard with infrastructure metrics [#collaborate]

Let's say that every week, you notice that your system experiences high latency. One or more apps slow down dramatically for about an hour, then resolve themselves within two hours. From what you can tell from the data, no one implements a change to trigger the resolution, and it's not entirely obvious what causes the behavior to begin with.

    ### Troubleshoot your host data

When troubleshooting an anomolous situation, we recommend following strategies covered in the previous docs to explore host data. For example, using the time picker to toggle between time periods, or filtering down to the anomolous hosts. 

* Use the time picker to find when your host behavior changes.
* Filter your data down to hosts that might be affected by the incident. You might find that some hosts show a change in behavior, but they may not meet existing alert thresholds. In that case, consider creating new alerts that address your current scenario.

Here's an example of a host page filtered down to the two hosts that are affected by the scenario:

    ### Add metrics from the Metrics Explorer

To create a custom dashboard, we recommend   This is useful if a certain process causes routine issues under certain conditions and you want that data to be readily accessible for your team and external teams. To do that:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**, then find the hosts where this process occurs.
2. Click the host that runs the process from the summary table. In this case, we'll select `apache_svr01`. This opens a new page with data scoped just to that specific host.
3. Click **Metrics explorer**. Choose the metric and dimensions you want the graph to represent. For our purposes, we've chosen `host.process.threadCount` and have grouped it by `apmApplicationNames`. 
4. Click the ellipses and select **Add to dashboard**.

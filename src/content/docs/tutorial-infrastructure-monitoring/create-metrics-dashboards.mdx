title: Create custom dashboards with infrastructure metrics
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure.

You might encounter anomalous behavior that isn't widespread, but affects certain parts of your system. Maybe behavior changes once a week on a consistent cadence, then resolves itself just as reliably. Your data doesn't indicate any definitive deployment, upgrade, or redundant process, so you're uncertain about the cause. 

In this case, you can use infrastructure data to create a custom dashboard to help you correlate a cause. This process lets you take data collected by the infrastructure agent and build a narrative around the incident. With cases like this, you check your dashboard over an extended period of time, like several days or a few weeks, until a causal pattern reveals itself. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial shows you how to create a custom dashboard based on host metrics. 

## Create a custom dashboard with infrastructure metrics [#collaborate]

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Install a custom dashboard 


    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Add metrics from the Metrics Explorer

To create a custom dashboard, we recommend  To do that:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**, then find the hosts where this process occurs.
2. Click the host that runs the process from the summary table. In this case, we'll select `apache_svr01`. This opens a new page with data scoped just to that specific host.
3. Click **Metrics explorer**. Choose the metric and dimensions you want the graph to represent. For our purposes, we've chosen `host.process.threadCount` and have grouped it by `apmApplicationNames`. 
4. Click the ellipses and select **Add to dashboard**.

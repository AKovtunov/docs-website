title: Build custom dashboards to troubleshoot recurring incidents
metaDescription: Solve system outages by investigating resource bottlenecks across your system infrastructure.

You might encounter anomalous behavior that isn't widespread, but affects certain parts of your system. Maybe behavior changes once a week on a consistent cadence, then resolves itself just as reliably. Your data doesn't indicate any definitive deployment, upgrade, or redundant process, so you're not sure what the cause is or what to recommend. 

In this case, you can use infrastructure data to create a custom dashboard to help you correlate a cause. This process lets you take data collected by the infrastructure agent and build a narrative around the incident. With cases like this, you check your dashboard over an extended period of time, like several days or a few weeks, until a causal pattern reveals itself. 

## Objectives [#objectives]

This tutorial shows you how to create a custom dashboard based on host metrics.

    ### Create a dashboard based on dimensional metrics

Let's say you want to create a dashboard around a certain kind of metrics, grouped by different parameters. This is useful if a certain process causes routine issues under certain conditions and you want that data to be readily accessible for your team and external teams. To do that:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All Capabilities > Infrastructure](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/hosts)**, then find the hosts where this process occurs.
2. Click the host that runs the process from the summary table. In this case, we'll select `apache_svr01`. This opens a new page with data scoped just to that specific host.
3. Click **Metrics explorer**. Choose the metric and dimensions you want the graph to represent. For our purposes, we've chosen `host.process.threadCount` and have grouped it by `apmApplicationNames`. 
4. Click the ellipses and select **Add to dashboard**.

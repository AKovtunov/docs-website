As the digital world continues to grow more tangled and complex, it's easy for DevOps teams to feel overwhelmed and New Relic's alerts and applied intelligence are the answer. 

With alerts, you can:

* Configure any signal to be evaluated against a threshold, or if it exhibits abnormal behavior.
* Organize alerts through [tagging](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/#query-tags).
* Identify [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence/) before they become broader issues.
* Route issues to the correct system or team using [notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/intro-notifications/).

New Relic applied intelligence allows you to:

* [Enrich](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/#enrichments) your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data.
* Normalize your data, group related incidents, and establish relationships between them.
* [Correlate](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/#what-is-correlaton) incoming incidents.
* Provide a [root cause analysis](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/Issues-and-Incident-management-and-response/#root-cause-analysis).
* Reduce and [suppress noisy alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/#configure-correlation).

## Alerting concepts and terms [#concepts-terms]

An alert is generated when one or more incidents match a threshold. This threshold has been previously included in a condition defined in a policy. You can configure notifications to inform you about the triggering event. These notifications are received by the right people who decide what to do with that alert.

To get the most of alerting, it's essential to understand some basic terms and concepts.

</table>

This diagram shows how alerts work: an alert policy is created including an alert condition or several alert conditions. When that or those conditions are breached by a defined threshold, an incident is triggered and a notification is sent. You can group incidents into issues and issues into decisions to have better management of your alerts.

## Using alerts, an example [#using-alerts]

Let's see how alerts work with a practical example. Let's say you want to receive a notification when a host's CPU goes above 80%. You should do the following:

<Steps>
<Step>
###  Create an alert condition [#create-condition]

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, select **Alert Conditions** on the left navigation panel, and click **+ New alert condition** to [create an alert condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).

<img
    width="90%;"
    title="New alert condition button"
    alt="New alert condition button"
    src={newAlertConditionButton}
/>

</Step>

<Step>
###  Set condition thresholds [#condition-thresholds]
Set a [condition threshold](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/set-thresholds-alert-condition/) that will open an incident with a severity level you configure, critical or warning.
    
<img
    width="30%;"
    title="Set condition thresholds"
    alt="Set condition thresholds"
    src={setConditionThresholds}
/>

</Step>

<Step>
###  Name your alert condition [#name-alert]

Name your alert condition and connect it to an existing [policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) or create a new one.

    <img
        width="60%;"
        title="Name your alert condition"
        alt="Name your alert condition"
        src={nameYourAlertCondition}
    />

</Step>

<Step>
###  Create an alert policy [#create-alert-policy]

Create an [alert policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy) and set up notifications.

    <img
        width="30%;"
        title="Create your alert policy"
        alt="Create your alert policy"
        src={createAlertPolicy}
    />

</Step>

<Step>
###  Configure a workflow [#configure-workflow]

Configure a new [workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) or select an existing one to make sure that the right people are notified about it.

    <img
        width="70%;"
        title="Create a new workflow to get nofified"
        alt="Create a new workflow to get nofified"
        src={createNewWorkflow}
    />

</Step>

<Step>
###  Create a decision [#create-decision]

Create a [decision](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/) if you want to correlate issues and reduce noise.

</Step>

## Note about EU/US data centers [#eu-datacenter]

New Relic's applied intelligence service is performed in the United States. By using New Relic applied intelligence, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or in our [EU region data center](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center/).

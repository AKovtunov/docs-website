As the digital world continues to grow more tangled and complex, it's easy for DevOps teams to feel overwhelmed and New Relic's alerts and applied intelligence are the answer. With alerts, you can configure, detect, and diagnose incidents, prioritize them, and take the needed immediate action. Use alerts to identify anomalies before they reach your end-user. 

Define the conditions in your system you want to know about and focus on the things you care about most. Use alert notifications and make sure that the right people are appropriately notified. You can enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Notifications are sent to third-party services, such as Atlassian Jira, AWS EventBridge, Email, New Relic mobile push, Opsgenie, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Slack, Splunk on-call (VictorOps), Webhook, and xMatters.

Applied intelligence is a machine-learning engine that proactively notifies your team about potential problems by identifying anomalous behavior, correlating any relevant incidents, alerting your team of active issues, and providing a root cause analysis. 

## Alerting concepts and terms [#concepts-terms]

An alarm is generated when one or more incidents match a threshold. This threshold has been previously included in a condition defined in a policy. You can configure notifications to inform you about the triggering event. These notifications are received by the right people who decide what to do with that alarm.

To get the most of alerting, it's essential to understand some basic terms and concepts.

* **[Incident](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-incident)** is an event generated when a condition threshold is breached. It's an individual event that details a symptom of a problem.
* **[Issue](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#issue)** is a collection of one or more incidents that requires attention and investigation and causes a notification.
* **[Event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#events-new-relic)** is a record of activity, which contains information and that resides in a log file. 
* **[Threshold](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-threshold)** is a value that you configure to trigger an incident.
* **[Alert condition](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-condition)** is a configuration of parameters that you set up to trigger an incident.
* **[Alert policy](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-policy)** is a group of alert conditions that you configure to get notified when an incident occurs.
* **[Alert notification](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-notification)** is a message that you receive when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes.
* **[Decision](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/)** is a logical operation that group issues into larger issues. There are built-in decisions and you can also create your own custom decisions.
* **[Workflow](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#workflows)** is the definition of when and where you want to receive notifications about issues. You can enrich your notifications with additional and related New Relic data.
* **[Destination](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#destinations)** is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use.

### Note about EU/US data centers [#eu-datacenter]

New Relic's incident intelligence service is performed solely in the United States. By using New Relic incident intelligence, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or in our [EU region data center](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center/). If you elect to use the suggested responder feature and manage EU-based individuals, you may need to confirm that an appropriate data processing agreement is in place.

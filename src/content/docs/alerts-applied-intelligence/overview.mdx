As the digital world continues to grow more tangled and complex, it's easy for DevOps teams to feel overwhelmed and New Relic's alerts and applied intelligence are the answer. With alerts, you can configure, detect, and diagnose incidents, prioritize them, and take the needed immediate action. Use alerts to identify anomalies before they reach your end-user. 

Define the conditions in your system you want to know about and focus on the things you care about most. Use alert notifications and make sure that the right people are appropriately notified. You can enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Notifications are sent to third-party services, such as Atlassian Jira, AWS EventBridge, Email, New Relic mobile push, Opsgenie, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, Slack, Splunk on-call (VictorOps), Webhook, and xMatters.

Applied intelligence is a machine-learning engine that proactively notifies your team about potential problems by identifying anomalous behavior, correlating any relevant incidents, alerting your team of active issues, and providing a root cause analysis. 

## Alerting concepts and terms [#concepts-terms]

An alarm is generated when one or more incidents match a threshold. This threshold has been previously included in a condition defined in a policy. You can configure notifications to inform you about the triggering event. These notifications are received by the right people who decide what to do with that alarm.

To get the most of alerting, it's essential to understand some basic terms and concepts.

This diagram shows how alerts work: an alert policy is created including an alert condition or several alert conditions. When that or those conditions are breached by a defined threshold, an incident is triggered and a notification is sent. You can group incidents into issues and issues into decisions to have better management of your alarms.

Let's see how alerts work with a practical example. Let's say you want to receive a notification when a host's CPU goes above 80%. The first thing you need to do is [create an alert condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/) and set a [condition threshold](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/set-thresholds-alert-condition/) that will open an incident with a severity level you configure, critical or warning. Then you can connect that condition to an existing [policy](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) or create a new one. After this, you need to configure a [workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to make sure that the right people are notified about it.

### Note about EU/US data centers [#eu-datacenter]

New Relic's incident intelligence service is performed in the United States. By using New Relic incident intelligence, you agree that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. This applies whether you store your data in New Relic's US region data center or in our [EU region data center](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center/). If you elect to use the suggested responder feature and manage EU-based individuals, you may need to confirm that an appropriate data processing agreement is in place.

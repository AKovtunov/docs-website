An alert condition is a series of parameters that you set up to trigger an incident. Defining conditions is going to help you to focus on the things you care about most. 

When one or more incidents match a threshold defined in an active alert condition, it generates an alert. You can correlate similar or related incidents to an issue and group alert conditions together to create an alert policy.

Let's open the alert conditions UI page. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert Conditions** on the left navigation pane.

Every alert condition has these options when you click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon:

  src={alertsIconOptions}
/>


## View existing conditions [#alert-condition-view]

The alert conditions page lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert Conditions** on the left navigation pane.
2. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a condition's name to see its configuration.


## Change the configuration of a condition [#change-condition]

You can change the configuration of your conditions. For example, you can change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc.

* Use camel case or dotted decimal notation.
* Describe the essence of what is being breached.

To change the configuration of a condition:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts & AI**, then click **Alert Conditions** on the left navigation pane.
2. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon of the condition you want to modify and select **Edit**.
3. Modify the values you need to.
4. Click **Save condition**.

You can't edit the ID, the account, and the policy associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different account and policy.

## Types of conditions [#condition-types]

Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
      id="anomaly-conditions"
      title="Anomaly conditions"
    >
      [Anomaly alerting](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-applied-intelligence/) allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for [APM](/introduction-apm) and [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) apps, as well as [NRQL queries](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/nrql-alert-conditions/).
    </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apm-conditions"
    title="APM metric alert conditions"
  >
    See [APM metric alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/other-condition-types/apm-metric-alert-conditions/) for tips about creating <InlinePopover type="apm" /> conditions using NRQL.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dynamic-targeting-tags"
    title="Dynamic targeting with tags"
  >
    The use of [tags](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/) allows you to filter down relevant [entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) in your condition.

    A single tag identifies **all** entities associated with that tag (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple tags only identify entities which share all the selected tags.

    Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set an [incident close timer](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-incidents/how-alert-condition-incidents-are-closed/#time-limit).

    To add, edit, or remove up to ten tags for a condition:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**. Select an app, then under the **Monitor** section, click **Transactions**.
    1. Select **APM > Application metric** as the product type.
    2. When identifying entities, select the **Labels** tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories.


    You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you're monitoring with [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="infrastructure"
    title="Infrastructure conditions"
  >
    You can [create conditions for your resources](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information) directly from our infrastructure monitoring UI.

    For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent, use the [host not reporting](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/create-infrastructure-host-not-reporting-condition) condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes.

  <Collapser
    id="instance-incidents"
    title="Java instance conditions"
  >
    You can set thresholds that open an incident when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics.

    By [scoping thresholds to specific instances](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/scope-alert-thresholds-specific-instances/), you can quickly identify the source of potential issues. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="jvm-metrics"
    title="JVM health metric conditions (Java apps)"
  >
    For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set [thresholds](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/set-thresholds-alert-condition/) that open an incident when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range.

    We evaluate alerting threshold breaches individually for each of the app's [selected instances](#instance-incidents). When creating your condition, select **JVM health metric** as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds:

    * Deadlocked threads
    * Heap memory usage
    * CPU utilization time
    * Garbage collection CPU time


    Incidents automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but you can change the time when an [incident](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-incident) force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-transactions"
    title="Key transaction metrics conditions"
  >
    For APM, you can set up conditions for [key transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/introduction-key-transactions).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="nrql-conditions"
    title="NRQL query conditions"
  >
    Use the UI or [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-nrql-condition-alerts/) to create [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/nrql-alert-conditions/).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="synthetics-multi-location"
    title="Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions"
  >
    With [multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/multi-location-synthetic-monitoring-alert-conditions/), you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="app-response-percentiles"
    title="Web transaction percentile conditions"
  >
    We include the option to define a percentile as the [threshold](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#alert-threshold) for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's **overall** [web transaction](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#transaction) response time rather than the **average** web response time.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a [non-web app transaction](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#non-web-transaction), use the [NRQL queries](#nrql-conditions) feature.
    </Callout>

    To define the percentile threshold:

    1. Select **Web transactions percentiles** as the type of condition for your <InlinePopover type="apm" /> app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual **Web transactions percentiles** condition for each.)
    2. To define the thresholds that open the incident, type the **Percentile nth** response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value).


    We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value.

## Apdex and response time conditions [#alert_response]

You can open incidents and send notifications for response times. However, [Apdex scores](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/view-your-apdex-score) are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience.

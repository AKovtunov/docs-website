When preparing for game day, your service levels and their alerts translates into meaningful alerts that notify you when thresholds are passed, namely when demand puts your app under stress, resulting in bottlenecks or outages. 

If New Relic out of the box gives you a high level overview of all your data, then workloads let you filter to specific sets of data. What you put in this set is up to you: maybe you only want a workload for an individual team, or maybe you want a workload specific to your gameday. Once you have a workload with multiple sources reporting data, you can use the UI to quickly navigate to other parts of the product. For example, if you've added logs, dashboards, APM services, and infrastructure to a workload, you can start finding your root cause from the workload itself instead of clicking through the **All capabilities** tab from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**. 

To create your first workload, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**, then click **Workloads** from the **Your system** category. At the top right of the waterfall view, click **Create a workload**.

## Create a workload for game day
        
The **Create a workload** page is a directory listing all entities and accounts you have access to. New Relic attaches tags to your data, which you can 

1. Select the owning account for a workload.
2. Name your workload, something like `Peak Demand Data` (or whatever is meaningful to you and your team). 
3. Query for different data sources. For example, you can query by entity: `Entity Type = Service - APM`. The view will filter for APM service entities, then you can add the individual services you want included in the workload.  

You have two options for adding a data source to a workload, the simple **Add** button next to individual sources or the **Add this query** button next to your query. 

* **Add** 
* **Add this query** next to the query box. When you choose **Add this query** automatically updates that data sour with any future additions to the `gameday2023` tag.

## Get the most out of workloads 

To get the most power out of workloads, we recommend you add these sources to your query:

* A gameday-specific tag that you can attach to multiple kinds of data sources, relevant to you.  
* Add `log` to your workloads query for easy access to the logs UI page.
* Add relevant dashboards to a workload, such as a dashboard that only displays your KPIs, or a dashboard of business critical transactions.

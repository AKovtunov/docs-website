If New Relic is a forest, then your ingested data can be thought of as thousands of trees inside it. You may know about the kind of trees in your forest, but finding the ones you want can feel daunting. To take the metaphor further: if New Relic is a forest, then you can think of workloads as a regional map for the relevant areas of your ingested data. 

In your planning phase, you can make sure your teams are aligned by creating workloads that centralize all the relevant data you need for the gameday. Maybe you only want a workload for an individual team, or maybe you want to go a little meta and create a workload of other workloads. They essentially work like this:

* Your agents report data about specific entities in your system
* Those entities are made up of transactions, APIs, traces, and logs
* You create service levels that 
* 

For example, if you've added logs, dashboards, APM services, and infrastructure to a workload, you can start finding your root cause from the workload itself instead of clicking through the **All capabilities** tab from **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**. 

To create your first workload, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**, then click **Workloads** from the **Your system** category. At the top right of the waterfall view, click **Create a workload**.

## Create a workload for game day
        
The **Create a workload** page is a directory listing all entities and accounts you have access to. New Relic attaches tags to your data, which you can 

1. Select the owning account for a workload.
2. Name your workload, something like `Peak Demand Data` (or whatever is meaningful to you and your team). 
3. Query for different data sources. For example, you can query by entity: `Entity Type = Service - APM`. The view will filter for APM service entities, then you can add the individual services you want included in the workload.  

You have two options for adding a data source to a workload, the simple **Add** button next to individual sources or the **Add this query** button next to your query. 

* **Add** 
* **Add this query** next to the query box. When you choose **Add this query** automatically updates that data sour with any future additions to the `gameday2023` tag.

## Get the most out of workloads 

To get the most power out of workloads, we recommend you add these sources to your query:

* A gameday-specific tag that you can attach to multiple kinds of data sources, relevant to you.  
* Add `log` to your workloads query for easy access to the logs UI page.
* Add relevant dashboards to a workload, such as a dashboard that only displays your KPIs, or a dashboard of business critical transactions.

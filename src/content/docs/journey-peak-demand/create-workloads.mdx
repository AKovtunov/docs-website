To review, you've created service levels and attached quality alerts to those service levels. When preparing for game day, this translates into meaningful alerts that notify you when thresholds are passed, namely when demand puts your app under stress, resulting in bottlenecks or outages. 

But you're not getting a high level overview of what's happening yet. When preparing for game day, creating workloads is a strong position to start from because they pull high level metrics together into a cohesive whole. Service levels roll into workloads, and workloads convey the same information (like what entities are alerting) to the same teams.

Eliminating data silos and aligning all teams together is one part of being successful on game day. 

## Create a workloads [#team]

Let's say your org runs lean for game day, with three teams responsible for infrastructure, web app, and business.

When you create a workload, you can add data from across different accounts. In this case, each node in your workload corresponds to one of the three teams relevant to game day, none of which are using one singular account.

        ### Find workloads in the UI

        Without workloads, each team is in their own silo. If an incident occurs, the conversation begins with "Who owns this problem?" instead of 
        "What's causing the problem?" 

        To create your first workload, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**, then click **Workloads** from the **Your system** category. At the top right of the waterfall view, click **Create a workload**.

        ### Create a workload for game day
        
        The **Create a workload** page is similar to a directory that lists all of the entities and accounts you have access to in an organization. If you want to create a workload for game day, you can query across the organization to get the accounts or entities you need. If you've incorporated tagging into your observability workflow, you can query by tags, too. 

        * Select the account you want the workload to live in
        * Query your org for different data sources. For example,

Your company projected a peak demand period during their upcoming event. You've been tasked with something that, at its surface, seems fairly straight forward: keep your app performing for customers. But the request is as complex as your org is, with many teams owning many different capabilities across the product. How do you move forward?

This tutorial can help you prepare for game day. First, it'll guide you through some basic planning recommendations, then it'll show you how to follow the data when responding to incidents.

Let's get started. 

## Instrument with the infrastructure and APM agents [#instrument]

Before jumping into a game day, you need to find your baselines. This means determining how your entire system performs on an ordinary day by averaging performance over time. You'd ideally collect this data over a period of several months, which allows you to set SLA goals with precise, relevant data. For now, though, let's focus on getting you set up with our infrastructure and APM agents.

* To install the infrastructure agent, follow our [guided install](). An agent is the mechanism by which New Relic collects data about your system. By installing the infrastructure agent, you'll get out of the box data about CPU, memory, and file utilization.
* To install the APM agent, follow our [guided install](). The APM agent collects data about throughput, response time, and any errors.

Taken together, you have a solid foundation to set up New Relic for a game day.

## Seeing the forest for the trees [#trees]

Congratulations! You've instrumented with a couple New Relic agents and have data flowing in. But New Relic's power isn't in the fact that data is reporting, though that *is* important. New Relic's power is its ability to surface the data that matters to you, your team, and your boss. But what does this mean?

Let's circle back to why we're here: you're tasked with maintaining performance during peak demand. You might assume this means maintaining perfection across your stack, but it doesn't. Rather, it means making a series of prioritization decisions that ensure that customers can always complete whatever task they've set out to do, whether that's logging in, adding an item to a cart, or making a purchase. 

The rest of the tutorial takes the data that's now being reported to New Relic so you can learn how to prioritize. You'll make informed baselines, get a primer on infrastructure scaling, create quality alerts, and see an example of responding to bottlenecks. In short, you'll learn to take granular data and act for the bigger picture.

Preparing for your company's big event can expose weak points in your observability practices. The simplest way to ensure that you're monitoring what's relevant for a peak day, week, or season  

There are three parts to setting up New Relic to notify you when a threshold has been exceeded. 

* Query already reported data to find a baseline.
* Take that baseline and create a service level around it. 
* Create an alert to notify you when certain circumstances are met. 

This tutorial walks you through the first two steps. 

## Identify your performance needs [#boundary]

Knowing what ordinary behavior looks like makes it easier to recognize and resolve anomalous behavior. Consider some common activities that may happen when a customer makes a purchase:

* Logging in
* Searching for an item
* Adding an item to a cart
* Making a payment  
* Order processing

These behaviors correlate to capabilities behind a web app. When you're choosing the focus for a game day, it's important correlate common customer needs to a capability in your stack. These capabilities should *always* meet demand because they drive business. 

Understanding baseline behavior lets you determine if a change in behavior is something to resolve. To use our barista example, a baseline behavior for a machine is around 25 seconds, so the barista at coffeeshop A knew it was time to troubleshoot when the machine was pulling at 15 seconds. 

## Find your baseline, then make a service level [#baseline]

Go to **[one.newrelic.com > Query Your Data](https://one.newrelic.com/data-exploration/query-builder)**. Because you're reporting to New Relic, you can query to retrieve any information about your app, so long as you know the syntax to expose it. 

Let's assume you don't. Take this NRQL query, which pulls out latency data about `Order-Processing`. If you're following along with your own app, be sure to change `appName='Order-Processing'`. 

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(duration, 95) AS 'Latency Baseline SLI' WHERE appName='Order-Processing' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO
```

This query shows that 95% of requests to `Order-Processing` received a response in less than 1.844(ms). But let's say you want to supplement this baseline with an error-free baseline. It'd look like this:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE error is false) AS 'Success Baseline SLI' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO WHERE appName='Order-Processing'
```

## Find acceptable thresholds for your service levels [#thresholds]

Now that you have some baselines, you can create a meaningful service level. From the **Query Your Data** page, head back to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM & Services**, then click **Service levels** under **Reports**.

When you add a new service level, New Relic will auto-populate a baseline for your entire app, meaning that New Relic will create a baseline for every transaction that occurs in your app. The baseline that we pulled from the previous section, however, is a baseline specific to `Order-processing`. 

In the `WHERE` box in the UI, add the following string to the end of the query so that it reads something like:

```sql
entityGUID = 'YOUR_GUID' AND (transactionType = 'Web') AND request.uri LIKE `Order-processing`
```

New Relic will update the rest of the form, so your last step is naming your new SLI.

title: Simplify kubernetes layers with New Relic

## Why

Understanding the inner workings of your Kubernetes system, specifically how all the different functions of the system come together, is inherently complex. Let's review what makes up a Kubernetes system and then dive into how New Relic can help monitor and understand each part.

## Break it apart to understand

To gain a better grasp of a Kubernetes system, let's break it down into distinct sections and explore how New Relic can help you comprehend each one effectively.

We'll discuss a Kubernetes system in three key sections:

  * **The Cluster**: This represents the entire Kubernetes system, like a vast bakery comprising multiple ovens, each with its own set of bakers. The cluster comprises multiple deployments, which, in turn, house numerous pods, with each pod containing its individual services.

  * **The Orchestrated**: These are the core elements of a Kubernetes system, akin to the individual baking stations within the bakery. Orchestrated components consist of deployments that, in turn, house pods, working together in harmony.

  * **The Services**: In the analogy of our bakery, these services are the heart of the system - the dedicated bakers running each oven. Similarly, within a Kubernetes system, each pod houses one or more services, providing the essential functionality that drives the system, whether it's computation, a web application, or any other purpose.

It's important to note that these sections are interrelated. The cluster section comprises multiple orchestrated sections, and each orchestrated section consists of multiple services sections.

The cluster dashboard acts as a crucial tool for monitoring and managing your Kubernetes clusters, giving you an encompassing view of your entire system, just like how the bakery's management oversees the entire bakery's operation.

### The Cluster

Imagine a Kubernetes cluster as an expansive bakery, equipped with multiple ovens and skilled bakers. When the bakery has only two or three ovens, and a few bakers, it's relatively manageable to oversee each oven unit personally. However, when we scale up to a nationwide bakery with dozens or hundreds of bakers and ovens, keeping track of every single unit becomes a large task.

Similarly, in a large Kubernetes system, with numerous deployments and pods, manually monitoring each component becomes impractical. New Relic offers a more efficient approach to oversee the entire system's health and receive timely alerts when issues arise.

The cluster overview dashboard empowers you to visualize your entire Kubernetes system, akin to viewing the health of the entire bakery. Additionally, the cluster explorer provides a comprehensive visualization of the system's health, while still enabling you to distinctly inspect individual units.

### The orchestrated

The orchestrated section of the Kubernetes system represents the backbone of your setup - the deployments that contain pods.

Continuing with our bakery analogy, the orchestrated section is akin to the baking stations within the bakery. Each station houses a set of ovens (pods) that work together to fulfill specific tasks.

### The services

In your bakery, each oven is run by a baker or two. These bakers are the heart of the system, providing the actual value - the bread! In our kubernetes system, each pod contains one or two services that provide the actual functionality that your kubernetes system supports - whether this is computation, a web app, or anything inbetween.

New Relic allows you to monitor each individual service within your Kubernetes pods. This granular level of monitoring allows you to gauge the performance, response times, and resource usage of specific services, ensuring optimal efficiency and responsiveness.

## [DASHBOARD SECTION]

[Intro to dashboard section]

### Cluster monitoring:

  * Checking node readiness: The dashboard shows whether nodes in the cluster are ready and able to host pods. Users can ensure that their cluster's infrastructure is prepared to handle workloads without any bottlenecks.

  * Resource count insights: Users can quickly assess the number of pods, containers, nodes, or other Kubernetes resources within the cluster. This enables them to monitor resource utilization and plan for scaling based on real-time data.

  * Identifying spike in warning events: The dashboard allows users to track Kubernetes warning events over time. This information helps identify any unusual spikes or patterns, enabling proactive troubleshooting before they escalate into critical issues.

### Orchestrated monitoring

 * Monitoring pending pods: Gain valuable insights into each deployment's performance. The dashboard pinpoints when one or more pods enter a pending state, helping you investigate the reasons behind delays and take appropriate action to avoid potential performance bottlenecks.

  * Identifying pending or failed pods: The dashboard instantly highlights any pods that are in a pending or failed state. This allows you to swiftly detect and address issues, ensuring that applications can run smoothly without delays or failures.

### Services section

  *  Detecting unhealthy resources: Users can easily spot any unhealthy Kubernetes resources, such as Daemonsets, Deployments, Statefulsets, HPAs, and more. With this visibility, they can promptly troubleshoot and optimize resource utilization for better performance.
  *  Assess service performance: Gauge the performance, response times, and resource usage of specific services, ensuring optimal efficiency and responsiveness.

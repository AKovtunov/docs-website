title: Simplify kubernetes layers with New Relic
---

## Why

Understanding the inner workings of your Kubernetes system, specifically how all the different functions of the system come together, is inherently complex. 

## Break it apart to understand

To better understand a Kubernetes system, let's break it apart into discrete parts and talk about how New Relic can help you understand each one.

We'll talk about a Kubernetes system in three distinct sections.:

* **The Cluster**: The entire Kubernetes system. The cluster is made out of multiple deplayments, which in turn are made out of multiple pods, which each contain their own services.
* **The Orchestrated**: The bulk of a kubernetes system. These are deployments which contain pods. 
* **The Services**: Individual services found on kubernetes pods. 

Note that these sections build on each other. 

The a `cluster` section is made out of multiple `orchestrated` sections which in turn is made out of multiple `services` sections.

The cluster dashboard can be an essential tool for monitoring and managing your Kubernetes clusters

## The Cluster

Think of a kubernetes cluster as an entire bakery, made out of multiple ovens and bakers.

 If you have just two or three ovens, each with one or two bakers, the system isn't that complex. You could keep an eye on every oven unit yourself! Let's expand that to a nationwide bakery - with dozens or hundreds of bakers. 
 
 There's no way to keep an eye on every single oven unit. You need an easier way to keep an eye on the health of the entire bakery, with ways to alert you when there's an issue with an oven unit.

The cluster overview dashboard gives you the ability to view your entire system. Or if we follow the analogy, it lets you see the health of your entire bakery. The cluster explorer on the other hand, shows you a visualtion of the health of your entire system but distinctly notes each indivudal unit.

## The orchestrated

The bulk of a kubernetes system. These are deployments which contain pods. Let's go back to our bakery. The deployments and pods are individual ovens and baking stations.

## The Services

In our bakery, each oven is run by a baker or two. These bakers are the heart of system, providing the actual value - the bread! In our kubernetes system, each pod contains one or two services that provide the actual functionality that your kubernetes system supports - whether this is computation, a web app, or anything inbetween.

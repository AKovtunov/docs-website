title: Understand your kubernetes system with New Relic
---

## Why

A kubernetes system is inherently complex. This isn't helped Kubernetes has a reputation as a system renowned for its intricacy and as a challenging technology to grasp. In this tutorial series, we will delve into how New Relic can assist you in monitoring your Kubernetes system's health and streamline your understanding of it.

Throughout this documentation, we will provide step-by-step guidance on leveraging New Relic's to effectively monitor your Kubernetes environment. Additionally, you will discover how New Relic's advanced features can reduce the overhead associated with comprehending Kubernetes, simplifying your operations. 

##  Prerequisites:

Before we begin, you'll have to set up New Relic with your Kubernetes system. The steps below guide you though the process:


<Steps>
    <Step>
  
## Set up Kubernetes 
Set up a Kubernetes cluster either locally using a tool like Minikube or on a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. 

    </Step>
    <Step>

## Install New Relic agent: 


The New Relic Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment by leveraging the New Relic infrastructure agent. This agent collects telemetry data from your cluster using several New Relic integrations such as the Kubernetes events integration, the Prometheus Agent, and the New Relic Logs Kubernetes plugin.


We have some links below that will take you to the guided install that is right for you. After you start the installation process, you can use the tips in the remainder of this guide to help you make decisions about the various setup options.

## Configure the agent: 

After installing the New Relic agent, you need to configure it with your New Relic account credentials. This involves setting environment variables or modifying a configuration file with your license key and other required settings.

## Instrument applications: 

While Kubernetes excels at abstracting away much of the toil associated with managing containerized workloads, it also introduces some complexities of its own. The Kubernetes environment includes an additional layer that comes into play between the application and the underlying infrastructure. The challenge of monitoring and maintaining the performance and health of these Kubernetes environments, or of troubleshooting issues when they occur, can be dauntingâ€”especially as organizations deploy these environments at massive scale.

    <Step>

## Monitor Kubernetes Components:

The newrelic-infrastructure chart is the main component of the integration. It's divided into three different components: nrk8s-ksm, nrk8s-kubelet, and nrk8s-controlplane. The first is a deployment and the next two are DaemonSets.

* nrk8s-kubelet
* nrk8s-ksm

    </Step>

    <Step>

## Explore New Relic Dashboard:

Once you have completed the installation and configuration, give it some time to collect data. Then, log in to your New Relic account and explore the provided dashboards, metrics, and monitoring features. You should be able to see information about your Kubernetes cluster, applications, and their performance metrics.
    </Step>   
</Steps>



## Next steps

Now that you've got your Kubernetes system set up with New Relic, we can start using the power of New Relic to gauge the health of your system and understand how it's all working together.

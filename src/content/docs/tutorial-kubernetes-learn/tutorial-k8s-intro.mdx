A Kubernetes system is inherently complex and Kubernetes as a whole has a reputation as intricate and challenging to grasp. Understanding Kubernetes as a concept is a complex task by itself and wanting to understand an indivdual Kubernetes system only adds more complextiy. How do you troubleshoot ephemeral containers that spin up and down before you can even access them? How do you understand the health of your system as a whole if you have hundreds of containers orchestrated at a time?

In this tutorial series, we will explore how you can monitor your Kubernetes system with New Relic and how it can streamline your understanding of the technology.

##  Get started:

To begin, you need to set up New Relic with your Kubernetes system. The steps below guide you though the process:

<Steps>
    <Step>

### Install New Relic agent: 


The New Relic Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment by leveraging the New Relic infrastructure agent. This agent collects telemetry data from your cluster using several New Relic integrations such as the Kubernetes events integration, the Prometheus Agent, and the New Relic Logs Kubernetes plugin.

There are various ways to integrate your Kubernetes system with New Relic. For this tutorial series, we highly reccomend using the guided install steps below. For other install paths, see [our Kubernetes install docs](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/).

Additionally, you can start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using our Auto-telemetry with Pixie. [Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie/).

<Step>
### Instrument applications

Kubernetes excels at abstracting away much of the toil associated with managing containerized workloads. That abstraction adds complexity when correlating indivdual applications to their underlying infrastructure. 

<img
    title="apm summary page"
    alt="A screenshot depicting the APM summary page."
    src={apmApmCompleteSummaryPage}
/>

To correlate data from applications in your Kubernetes pods to the kubernetes system as a whole, follow [the instructions in this doc](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/link-apm-applications-kubernetes/). This process will use our application performance monitoring (APM) capabilities to scrape your applications for performance data and send them to New Relic.
</Step>

<Step>
### Instrument services

Just like applications, correlating services such as Cassandra and MySQL with your Kubernetes data requires additional configuration. 


          <img
            title="New Relic infra page"
            alt="A screenshot showing the New Relic infrastructure monitoring UI."
            src={infraComplete}
          />

To correlate your data, see our doc on [monitoring services in Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/advanced-configuration/monitor-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes/). This process will use our on-host integrations for various supported services using a Helm Chart.

</Step>
<Step>
### Explore your new data

      alt="New Relic - Kubernetes Navigator entity details"
      src={k8sNavigatorAnimation}
    />

To confirm you're sending all your Kubernetes related data to New Relic, explore the Kubernetes charts. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Kubernetes**. Poke around your data and see if you can get a general sense of the health of your Kubernetes system. Once you're ready, proceed to the next steps.

## Next steps

You're now sending Kubernetes data to New Relic! From here you can start using the power of New Relic to gauge the health of your system and understand how it's all working together by following the rest of this tutorial series:

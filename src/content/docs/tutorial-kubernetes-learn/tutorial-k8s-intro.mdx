title: Understand your kubernetes system with New Relic
---

## Why

A kubernetes system is inherently complex. This tutorial series guide you through how New Relic can help you not only monitor the health of your Kubernetes system, but can also reduce the overhead of understanding a Kubernetes system.

##  Create a Kubernetes cluster: 

Set up a Kubernetes cluster either locally using a tool like Minikube or on a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.

## Install New Relic agent: 


The New Relic Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment by leveraging the New Relic infrastructure agent. This agent collects telemetry data from your cluster using several New Relic integrations such as the Kubernetes events integration, the Prometheus Agent, and the New Relic Logs Kubernetes plugin.


We have some links below that will take you to the guided install that is right for you. After you start the installation process, you can use the tips in the remainder of this guide to help you make decisions about the various setup options.

## Configure the agent: 

After installing the New Relic agent, you need to configure it with your New Relic account credentials. This involves setting environment variables or modifying a configuration file with your license key and other required settings.

## Instrument applications: 

New Relic can monitor applications running in your Kubernetes cluster by instrumenting them with a New Relic APM (Application Performance Monitoring) agent. Depending on your application's language or framework, you will need to follow the relevant  installation instructions to integrate it into your application code.

You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information.

Additionally, you can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using our Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. [Learn more about auto-telemetry with Pixie here].

## Monitor Kubernetes Components:

New Relic provides integrations to monitor Kubernetes-specific components like pods, deployments, services, and more. These integrations can give you insights into the performance and health of your Kubernetes cluster. Follow our docs [LINKS HERE] to enable these integrations and configure the monitoring settings.

## Explore New Relic Dashboard:

    Once you have completed the installation and configuration, give it some time to collect data. Then, log in to your New Relic account and explore the provided dashboards, metrics, and monitoring features. You should be able to see information about your Kubernetes cluster, applications, and their performance metrics.

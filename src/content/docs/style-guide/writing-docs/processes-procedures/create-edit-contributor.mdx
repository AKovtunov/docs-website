We welcome your contributions, whether you are a New Relic employee or a New Relic user! When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. While we don't want you to worry about style, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome [to take a look](/docs/style-guide/get-started/introduction-style-guide/).

## Contribute to our docs site [#edit-doc-button]

You can contribute to the docs site a few different ways. How you choose to contribute depends largely on your preference, but we do have some recommendations:

* For a simple copy edit, you can click the **Edit this doc** button found in the right nav of every doc.
* If you plan on contributing regularly or you have a project that requires one or more new docs contributions, we recommend forking our repo.
* You can draft in a word processor of your choice, upload the content to Google Docs, and reach out to the #help-documentation channel to have the doc added to the site.
* You can submit a jira to the docs team, or create a GitHub issue with your request.

Whatever your preference, this doc walks you through each process so you can start contributing today.

If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can edit the file directly from the docs site. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions.

To edit existing content without building the site locally, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the doc you'd like to edit on the docs site.
2. Click **Edit this doc** from the right nav.
    <img
    title="Make small changes to a doc"
    alt="Click the edit button to make small changes"
    src={styleguideEditDoc}
    />
3. Click the **pencil** icon to go into edit mode. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that).
    <img
    title="Click the pencil button"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguidePencilButton}
    /> 
4. When you're done editing, click **Commit changes**.
    <img
    title="Commit your changes"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguideCommitChanges}
    />
5. GitHub will prompt you to write a commit message, then ask where you'd like to put this commit. Always choose to **Create a new branch for this commit**. For the commit message, describe what you changed and why it's an improvement. 
    <img
    title="Write a commit message"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguideCommitMessage}
    />

Once you've proposed your changes, a member of the docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the **develop** branch, your changes will go live with our next release (usually within a few hours).

Forking the docs repo creates a copy of the docs site on your computer. This lets you edit the docs site similar to how the docs team might work in our day to day. Forking the repo happens in three stages: first, you create a fork on your GitHub account; second, you add your fork to your local files; finally, you sync your copy of the docs repo upstream. Syncing upstream lets you submit PRs to the docs team. 

Before you follow these steps, we recommend that you [install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). GitHub Desktop is a GUI that lets you follow the git process without the CLI. If you have previous git experience, this step is optional, but we find that our contributors have an easier time with this option.

## Create new docs [#creating-docs]

If you're unfamiliar with how to structure a new document, here are some tricks for getting started:

* Find a similar doc and use it as a guide to the layout.
* In the left navigation pane of the style guide, look under **Doc types and templates** for formatting tips.

To create a new doc:

1. Clone the repo on your computer.
2. In `/src/content/docs/`, find a good location for your doc.
3. Using your text editor, create a new `.mdx` file or copy an existing doc.
4. Write your content.
5. Optional: [Add your doc to the right nav `.yml` file](/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/understand-edit-docs-site-structure/). The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request.
6. Commit your changes and create a pull request.

The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place.

## For bigger projects [#bigger-projects]

If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see [Tech writer workflow](/docs/style-guide/writer-workflow/tech-writer-workflow/).

## Delete pages [#delete-doc]

If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the `i18n` folder. To request us to delete something:

1. [File an issue in the docs-website repo](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose), or contact the @hero in the #help-documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee.
2. We'll take a look at your issue and help out.

## Private edits [#private-edits]

If you need to stage content for a preview, contact the docs hero in the #help-documentation Slack channel.

## Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) [#hold-for-release]

If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #help-documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose).

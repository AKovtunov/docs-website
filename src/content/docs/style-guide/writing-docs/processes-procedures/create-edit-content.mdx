We welcome your contributions, whether you are a New Relic employee or a New Relic user! And we don't want you to worry about style. When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) [to take a look](/docs/style-guide/get-started/introduction-style-guide/).

## Edit a doc [#edit-doc]

If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions.

To edit existing content without building the site locally, check out this short video or follow the steps below:

<Video

1. On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit.
2. Click **Edit page** on the top corner of the right nav.
3. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the **pencil** icon in the top right.
4. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that).
5. At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click **Commit changes**.
6. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request.

A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the **Develop** branch, your changes will go live with our next release (usually within a few hours).

If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our [Contributors guide](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#editing-existing-pages) for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests.

## Edit an existing branch [#one-doc]

Do you want to contribute to an existing pull request? On GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Create a fork of the docs repo.
2. Commit your changes to the fork.
3. Merge your PR into the active branch.

## Edit a contributor's fork [#edit-fork]

If you are working with a contributor who is forking the docs site or some other site (for example, an internal GitHub Enterprise site), you have two options:

* [Clone fork and push changes into same branch](#push-to-same-branch): Good for small changes
* [Clone fork and create new branch](#push-to-different-branch): Best for complex changes

### Clone fork and push changes into same branch [#push-to-same-branch]

If you are collaborating with someone in their fork and your changes are going to be small (easy to back out), you can make changes directly in your contributor's fork.

Mention to your colleague that you'd like to make direct pushes to their fork and ask them to grant you write permission.

Once you have permission to write to that forked repository, here are the basic steps to complete in GitHub Desktop:

1. Go to GitHub, open their fork, click **Code**, and copy the URL to clone (either HTTPS or SSH).
2. In GitHub Desktop under **Current Repository**, click **Add > Clone Repository**.
3. Under **Clone a Repository**, click the **URL** tab, and complete the following:
    * In **Repository URL**, paste the URL.
    * In **Local Path**, modify the name of the directory to differentiate it from the main repository. For example, you could add the word `fork` to the directory name.
4. Click **Continue**.
5. Under **How are you planning to use this fork?**, select **For my own purposes**, and then click **Continue**.
7. Switch to your new repository and select the original branch used by the contributor.
8. Perform a pull to get the latest changes from your colleague.
    <Callout variant="important">
      Remember to always perform a pull before you start making any changes. This reduces the likelihood that you will cause a Git conflict.
    </Callout>
9. Make your changes, commit, and push to GitHub.

### Clone fork and create new branch [#push-to-different-branch]

If the changes you'd like to make in your colleague's fork are going to be complex (a proposal that would be difficult to back out), you can clone the contributor's fork, and then create a branch off the contributor's branch. After you complete your changes, you can create a pull request asking the contributor to review your changes.

To do this routine, you'd do steps 1 through 8 listed in [Clone fork and push changes into same branch](#push-to-same-branch). After you complete those steps, do these additional steps:

1. In GitHub Desktop, create a new branch in the fork based on your contributors original branch.
2. Switch to that new branch.
3. Make your changes, commit, and push to GitHub.
4. Click the GitHub Desktop icon **Create pull request**.
5. Complete the pull request in GitHub, making sure that the destination is the original directory used by your collaborator.

## Create new docs [#creating-docs]

If you're unfamiliar with how to structure a new document, here are some tricks for getting started:

* Find a similar doc and use it as a guide to the layout.
* In the left navigation pane of the style guide, look under **Doc types and templates** for formatting tips.

To create a new doc:

1. Clone the repo on your computer.
2. In `/src/content/docs/`, find a good location for your doc.
3. Using your text editor, create a new `.mdx` file or copy an existing doc.
4. Write your content.
5. Optional: [Add your doc to the right nav `.yml` file](/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/understand-edit-docs-site-structure/). The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request.
6. Commit your changes and create a pull request.

The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place.

## For bigger projects [#bigger-projects]

If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see [Tech writer workflow](/docs/style-guide/writer-workflow/tech-writer-workflow/).

## Delete pages [#delete-doc]

If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the `i18n` folder. To request us to delete something:

1. [File an issue in the docs-website repo](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose), or contact the @hero in the #help-documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee.
2. We'll take a look at your issue and help out.

## Private edits [#private-edits]

If you need to stage content for a preview, contact the docs hero in the #help-documentation Slack channel.

## Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) [#hold-for-release]

If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #help-documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose).

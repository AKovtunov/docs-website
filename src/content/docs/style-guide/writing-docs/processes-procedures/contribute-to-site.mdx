The docs team welcomes your contributions, whether you're a New Relic employee or a New Relic user. Regardless of how you contribute, a team of tech writers will review your update for style, grammar, and formatting. The process looks like this:

* You make an edit
* You submit it to the team in the form of a pull request
* We spruce up the writing per our style guide
* Your improvement is merged into the existing content

Your expertise is key to making our docs great, but how should you edit? This doc walks you through three different methods that let you make updates to the docs site. Once you're set up, you can file your first test edit or review some of our recommended style guide docs. 

## Prerequisites [#prereq]

Whatever method you choose, you need to sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you haven't yet.

GitHub is a version control tool. When you propose a change to the docs site, GitHub creates a separate version of the site that houses your change. This allows the docs team to review and approve changes before they're released to the site. You don't need to fully understand how version control works, but you might encounter some unfamiliar terms.   

* A **commit** acts like a save. 
* A **branch** is your version of the docs site created when you make a change. A branch houses your commit(s).
* A **pull request** packages your branch. When you create a pull request, your changes are sent to the docs team. This lets us collaborate with you before we release to the site. 

By hosting the site on GitHub, we're able to work with anyone who wants to contribute, whether they're a project manager, engineer, or a passionate user

<Callout variant="tip">
If you're a New Relic employee, we recommend joining the New Relic org on GitHub. To join the org, ping the @hero at #help-opensource on Slack.

For most cases, we recommend editing the  docs site via your browser. On each docs page, you can click **Edit this doc** to directly edit the content on the page. 

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Click **Edit this doc** 

On the doc you'd like to edit, click **Edit this doc** from the right nav. This opens a text view of the doc in question, letting you view the copy alongside its code. 
    
  <img
    title="Make small changes to a doc"
    alt="Click the edit button to make small changes"
    src={styleguideEditDoc}
  />

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Make your edits 

Once you've opened the text-version of a doc, find the **pencil** icon in the top nav of the text element. This lets you interract with the doc in edit mode rather than the default view-only mode. 

    <img
    title="Click the pencil button"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguidePencilButton}
    /> 

Make your edits, and don't worry too much about formatting or grammar. We're happy to take care of that.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Apply your changes

  <img
      title="Commit your changes"
      alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
      src={styleguideCommitChanges}
  />

Once you're ready to save your progress, click the **Commit changes...** button. This brings you to a page that looks like this:

  <img
    title="Write a commit message"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguideCommitMessage}
  />

Let's break down what this form is asking:

* **Commit message**: Required. A commit message is a brief explanation of what you changed. For example, one might read like: `Updated requirements and added content to install procedures`
* **Extended description**: Optional, but helps the docs team review your changes faster. This space  can add additional context about the change: `Existing install procedures caused customer confusion`.
* Always choose **Create a new branch for this commit...**. Creating a branch captures your changes. We will not accept any contribution made directly to `develop`.

There are no hard and fast rules about how often you should commit. You can make as many or as little commits to your branch as you'd like.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Work in your new pull request

Your changes—that is, your  branch and its commits—will be packaged into a pull request. This essentially creates a working space for you and anyone who wants to review your work. Here's an example pull request page:

  <img
    title="Your PR and you"
    alt="Your pull request is a working space for your contributions"
    src={styleguidePRpage}
  />

The two main areas you'll be in are **Conversation** and **Files changed**.

* The **Conversation** tab is where you can see comments, like feedback from the docs team. 
    * You can manage the status of your pull request as well. Scroll to **Projects** in the right nav and choose the status of your pull request. If it's a work in progress, put in **Drafts**. When you're finished, put it in **Hero to triage**.
      <img
      title="Change the status of your project"
      alt="Your pull request is a working space for your contributions"
      src={styleguideManageProjects}
      />
    * Alternatively, if you scroll to the bottom of the pull request page, you can find the comment box. Many contributors leave updates about the status of their work, like when they'd like their contributions reviewed and released.
* The **Files changed** tab lets you review or continue your work. Click the ellipses to open up the text edit view. You can continue to make commits from this tab. 
      <img
        title="Your PR workspace"
        alt="The files changed tab lets you continue work on a doc"
        src={styleguideContinueWorkPR}
      />
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Wait for a docs review

  A tech writer will assign the pull request to themself when it's in review. You can track the status of your pull request from **Projects** in the right nav. Make sure to return to your pull request for any changes requested or follow-up questions from a writer. 
  
  When your pull request has been reviewed and OK'd by the team, you'll see a purple button that says **Merged**. At this point you'll see your changes reflected on the live docs after our scheduled releases. We have them three times a day: morning, afternoon, and evening. 
    </Step>
</Steps>

        <TabsPageItem id="copy-repo">

You can also copy a version of the docs repo to your GitHub account and local machine. This gives you more flexibility when you make contributions in exchange for some upfront work. A typical contributor who works this way may edit in VS Code and make commits and pull requests via GitHub Desktop. 

This process has three broad phases: 

1. You fork, or copy, the docs site repo to your GitHub account and local machine.
2. You sync your clone of the docs site upstream to the actual repo. When you fork a repo, you're making a disconnected copy that's hosted on your GitHub account. For your contributions to make it to the docs site, you have to sync your copy to the original. 
3. You submit a test PR to confirm you've completed these steps successfully.

If you're choosing this method, we recommend that you [[install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This is a GUI that handles git commands for you so you don't need to open your CLI.

<Steps>
    <Step>
      ### Copy the docs site to your GitHub account

      From the [docs-website repo](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website), click the **Fork** button. GitHub will prompt you to choose an owner, repo name, and description. Make sure you choose **Copy the `develop` branch only**.

      <SideBySide>
    <Side>
        <img
          title="Fork the docs repo"
          alt="Click the fork button"
          src={styleguideForkRepo}
        />
    </Side>
    <Side>
        <img
          title="Fork the docs repo"
          alt="Click the fork button"
          src={styleguideForkModal}
        />    
        </Side>
</SideBySide>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      ### Clone your copy to your local machine

      From your GitHub account profile, find your newly copied `docs-website` repo. When you clicked **Fork**, it only created a copy to your GitHub account. To create a version in your local files, click the **Code** button. Copy the HTTPS URL and open your CLI.
        
        <img
          title="Fork the docs repo"
          alt="Click the fork button"
          src={styleguideCloneFork}
        />

      You need to choose where you want the docs site to live. 
      
      * If you want your copy to live in your Documents folder, then you'd run this command to ensure that your copied repo goes to your Documents folder: `cd /Users/YOUR_ACCOUNT/Documents`.
      * Using the HTTPS URL you copied from the previous step, run this command: `git clone <YOUR_PASTE_OF_HTTPS_URL>` 

    </Step>
    <Step>
      ### Connect your copy with the original docs repo
        
      If you tried to create a PR at this stage, you'd only be changing your version of the docs site — the docs team wouldn't receive your PR. The following steps establish a connection between your fork and the original docs repo, a process called syncing upstream.

      1. Go to the [docs-website repo](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website) and click the **Code** button. Copy the HTTPS URL just as you did in the previous step. Unlike in the last step,you're copying the HTTPS URL of the docs repo, **not** your fork.
      2. Change the directory to the location of your cloned fork. For example, if you copied to your Documents folder, the command would read: `cd /Users/YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/Documents/docs-website` 
      3. Run `git remote -v`
      4. Run `git remote add upstream <HTTPS_URL_HERE>`
      5. Run `git remote -v` to confirm you successfully added the upstream repo. It should look different from what printed in step 3:

      ```git
        git remote -v
        origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
        origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
        upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
        upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Set up GitHub Desktop to create pull requests
        
      At this stage, we recommend you open up GitHub Desktop to edit the docs site rather than using git from your CLI. If you're a git wiz, then you can skip this step and file your first pull request.

      From GitHub Desktop, go to **File**, then click **Add local repository**. Use the finder to add your clone of the docs  site.

      To create a test pull request:

      1. Create a new branch.
          Image
      2. Open the `docs-website` folder in VS Code or an editor of your choice. Make sure you're working on your new branch.
      3. Make an edit to any doc and save your changes. In GitHub Desktop, you should see your changes r eflected in the **Changes** tab:
          IMAGE
      4. In the **Summary (required)** field, describe  your changes. If you're just making a test edit, you can write: Test pull request, do not merged. Click **Commit**.
      5. Follow the prompts to file the pull request.

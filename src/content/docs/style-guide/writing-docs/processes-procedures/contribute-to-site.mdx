The docs team welcomes your contributions, whether you're a New Relic employee or a New Relic user. Regardless of how you contribute, a team of tech writers will review your update for style, grammar, and formatting. The process looks like this:

* You make an edit
* You submit it to the team in the form of a pull request
* We apply some edits
* It gets released to our site during one of our scheduled releases

This doc walks you through three different methods that let you make updates to the docs site. Once you're set up, you can review our list of recommended docs at the bottom, or jump straight into making our docs site better.

If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can edit the file directly from the docs site. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions.

To edit existing content without building the site locally, follow the steps below:


1. Go to the doc you'd like to edit on the docs site.
2. Click **Edit this doc** from the right nav.
    <img
    title="Make small changes to a doc"
    alt="Click the edit button to make small changes"
    src={styleguideEditDoc}
    />
3. Click the **pencil** icon to go into edit mode. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that).
    <img
    title="Click the pencil button"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguidePencilButton}
    /> 
4. When you're done editing, click **Commit changes**.
    <img
    title="Commit your changes"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguideCommitChanges}
    />
5. GitHub will prompt you to write a commit message, then ask where you'd like to put this commit. Always choose to **Create a new branch for this commit**. For the commit message, describe what you changed and why it's an improvement. 
    <img
    title="Write a commit message"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguideCommitMessage}
    />

Once you've proposed your changes, a member of the docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the **develop** branch, your changes will go live with our next release (usually within a few hours).

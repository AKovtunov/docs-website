The docs team welcomes your contributions, whether you're a New Relic employee or a New Relic user. Regardless of how you contribute, a team of tech writers will review your update for style, grammar, and formatting. The process looks like this:

* You make an edit
* You submit it to the team in the form of a pull request
* We spruce up the writing per our style guide
* Your improvement is merged into the existing content

Your expertise is key to making our docs great, but how should you edit? This doc walks you through three different methods that let you make updates to the docs site. Once you're set up, you can file your first test edit or review some of our recommended style guide docs. 


## Prerequisites [#prereq]

Whatever method you choose, you need to sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you haven't yet.


GitHub is a version control tool. When you propose a change to the docs site, GitHub creates a separate version of the site that houses your change. This allows the docs team to review and approve changes before they're released to the site. You don't need to fully understand how version control works, but you might encounter some unfamiliar terms.   

* A **commit** acts like a save. 
* A **branch** is your version of the docs site created when you make a change. A branch houses your commit(s).
* A **pull request** packages your branch. When you create a pull request, your changes are sent to the docs team. This lets us collaborate with you before we release to the site. 

By hosting the site on GitHub, we're able to work with anyone who wants to contribute, whether they're a project manager, engineer, or a passionate user

<Callout variant="tip">
If you're a New Relic employee, we recommend joining the New Relic org on GitHub. To join the org, ping the @hero at #help-opensource on Slack.

For most cases, we recommend editing the  docs site via your browser. On each docs page, you can click **Edit this doc** to directly edit the content on the page. 

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Click **Edit this doc** 

On the doc you'd like to edit, click **Edit this doc** from the right nav. This opens a text view of the doc in question, letting you view the copy alongside its code. 
    
  <img
    title="Make small changes to a doc"
    alt="Click the edit button to make small changes"
    src={styleguideEditDoc}
  />

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Make your edits 

Once you've opened the text-version of a doc, find the **pencil** icon in the top nav of the text element. This lets you interract with the doc in edit mode rather than the default view-only mode. 

    <img
    title="Click the pencil button"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguidePencilButton}
    /> 

Make your edits, and don't worry too much about formatting or grammar. We're happy to take care of that.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Apply your changes

Once you're ready to save your progress, click the **Commit changes...** button. This brings you to a page that looks like this:

    <img
    title="Commit your changes"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguideCommitChanges}
    />

Always choose to **Create a new branch for this commit**. For the commit message, describe what you changed and why it's an improvement. 

There are no hard and fast rules about when you should make a commit. You can do it as little or as often as you like. For example, if you plan on adding a new section to the site, you can commit after every sentence, or make one commit with all your changes. 

    <img
    title="Write a commit message"
    alt="Click the pencil button to go into edit mode"
    src={styleguideCommitMessage}
    />

Once you've proposed your changes, a member of the docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the **develop** branch, your changes will go live with our next release (usually within a few hours).

        Forking the docs repo gives you write access to a version of the docs site, letting you submit PRs to the docs team. This process requires some upfront work, but lets you make larger, more routine contributions to the docs site. 

        This process has three broad steps: first, you fork the repo to your GitHub account and make a clone in your local files; second, you sync your clone upstream, establishing a connection between your fork and the original repo; finally, you submit a test PR to confirm you've completed these steps successfully.

These are the different parts of the summary page:

- **Exploitable vulnerabilities by severity**. Check out a summary of the number of vulnerabilities you have by the [CVSS severity score](/docs/iast/overview/#vuln-severity): critical, high, and the total number of vulnerabilities. 

- **Exploitable categories detected**. This is an ordered list of the most exploitable categories detected.

- **Applications detected during testing**. Have at a glance the number of vulnerable applications you have.

- **IAST coverage**. Pie chart for having a view of the total number of applications and the number of tested and untested.

- **Take these actions**. This table shows you a list of the most exploitable applications. You can click on an application and the vulnerability page for that application will open. There is also a list of the untested applications. Click on an application if you want to [enable IAST](/docs/iast/applications/#enable-iast).

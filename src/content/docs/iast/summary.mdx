- **Exploitable categories detected**. This is an ordered list of the most exploitable categories detected.

- **Applications detected during testing**. Take a glance at the number of vulnerable applications you have.

- **IAST coverage**. Pie chart for having a view of the total number of applications and the number of tested and untested applications.

- **Take these actions**. This table shows you a list of the most exploitable applications. Click on an application to open its specific vulnerability page. There is also a list of the untested applications. Click on an untested application if you want to [enable IAST](/docs/iast/applications/#enable-iast).

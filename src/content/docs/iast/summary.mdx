The New Relic IAST summary page provides a centralized view of your tested applications and your vulnerabilities at a glance. View vulnerabilities and their risk scores helps you to prioritize remediation decisions.

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > IAST** to open the IAST summary page.

The IAST summary page includes these sections on the left navigation pane:

- **A: Overview**. When you open the [IAST UI](https://one.newrelic.com/iast/summary), you start out on the IAST summary page.

- **B: Findings**. It includes the pages on [vulnerabilites](/docs/iast/exploitable-vulns/), [coverage](/docs/iast/coverage/), and [applicatons](/docs/iast/applications/).

- **C: Settings**. This section includes the [install page](/docs/iast/install/) to start testing your applications for any exploitable vulnerability.


These are the different parts of the summary page:

- **Exploitable vulnerabilities by severity**. Check out a summary of the number of vulnerabilities you have by the [CVSS severity score](/docs/iast/overview/#vuln-severity): critical, high, and the total number of vulnerabilities. 

- **Exploitable categories detected**. This is an ordered list of the most exploitable categories detected.

- **Applications detected during testing**. Take a glance at the number of vulnerable applications you have.

- **IAST coverage**. Pie chart with a view of the total number of applications and the number of tested and untested applications.

- **Take these actions**:
    - **Fix these exploitable applications**. This table shows you a list of the most exploitable applications. Click on an application to view and fix the exploitable vulnerabilities in your applications. 
    
    - **Protect untested applications**. This is a list of the untested applications. Click on an untested application if you want to [enable IAST](/docs/iast/applications/#enable-iast) and find vulnerabilities to improve your security coverage.

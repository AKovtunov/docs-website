The security of your software applications is essential to protect sensitive data, maintain the trust of your users, and comply with regulatory requirements. New Relic Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) can help you to prevent cyberattacks and breaches on your applications at build time by ensuring your applications and services can't be exploited.

IAST helps you:

- Have a real-time visibility and context into security findings and a guide remediation.
- Ship code faster with unmatched detection accuracy of security risks.
- See and secure every application you build and run with full visibility into your code, web components, and configuration data.
- Provide real-time vulnerability detection and response for any application reducing false positives.
- Reduce the time and cost to eliminate vulnerabilities earlier in the software development lifecycle.
- Cut down the noise from both static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) analysis.

IAST is fully integrated with [New Relic Vulnerability Management](/docs/vulnerability-management/overview/), allowing you to continuously find, fix, and verify high-risk vulnerabilities across the software development lifecycle easily. IAST's exclusive proof of exploits feature built into the QA process eliminates developer time sinks chasing false positives, reproducing vulnerabilities, and working low-impact security risks.

You can use IAST to test applications written in the following languages:

- [Java](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-java-agent#support-matrix)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-node-agent/#supported--modules)
- [Go](https://github.com/newrelic/csec-go-agent/tree/v0.1.0#support-matrix)

Follow [these instructions](/docs/iast/install/) to install New Relic IAST.

## About IAST applications [#about-applications]

An application [entity(/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) is user-defined within the New Relic platform. IAST uniquely identifies an application via entity information. However, each IAST test runs as a separate UUID, that is unique per application based on the startup of the entity instance. This allows the user to track results for multiple tests run across applications, even when restarted. 

IAST takes into account the number of active contributing developers.
This means that IAST has an add-on charge per application, that is based on the entity and number of active contributing developers, regardless of how many times you start and stop it. 

A single application is defined as an application being developed by 20 or fewer developers. Up to 10 additional developers are considered as 2 applications.


## About Vulnerability Severity [#vuln-severity]

Discovering a vulnerability is important, but can be of little use without the ability to estimate a severity to each vulnerability. IAST assigns a qualitative severity to each vulnerability found in the system and according to the severity score of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss). IAST works on CVSS version 3 (CVSSv3) for scoring.

The following table shows the version 3 (CVSSv3) ratings.

        <tr>
            <th>
                Severity

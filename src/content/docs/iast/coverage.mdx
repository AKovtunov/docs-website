Through the coverage page you can see how many of your applications have or haven't been tested for exploitable vulnerabilities, as well as an overview of the health of all your applications. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > IAST** and click **Coverage** to open the page. 

If you see an application under **Untested applications** that you want to test for exploitable vulnerabilities, click **Set up IAST** to [enable the untested application](/docs/iast/applications/#enable-iast).

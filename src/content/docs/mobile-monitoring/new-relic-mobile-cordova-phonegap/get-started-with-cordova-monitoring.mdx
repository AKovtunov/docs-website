The New Relic Cordova agent monitors native applications (iOS, Android) built on the [Apache Cordova framework](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/index.html). Written in JavaScript, the Cordova agent also includes all New Relic mobile monitoring features for native apps. Once installed, the Cordova agent can:

* Detect the platforms added to your Cordova application and apply the most recent release of the relevant New Relic [Android](/docs/releases/android) or [iOS](/docs/releases/ios) agent
* Add post-build scripts for uploading iOS symbolication files
* Upload Android Proguard mapping files
* Automatically instrument mobile applications built via Cordova
* Capture JavaScript errors
* Generate distributed traces
* Track promise rejection (unhandled exceptiona in JavaScript)
* Track warnings and errors with console logs
* Capture interactions and their sequences
* Track user sessions

## Compatibility requirements [#requirements]

Before you install the Cordova agent, ensure your Flutter app meets these requirements:

For Android-native apps:
    * See [Android-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)

For iOS-native apps:
    * See [iOS-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements)

## Install

To install the Cordova agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/08jqaJD9pjl), located directly in the UI.

#### Cordova agent v6.2.0 and above:
JavaScript errors can be seen in the `Handled Exceptions` tab in New Relic One. You will be able to see the event trail, attributes, and stack trace for every JavaScript error recorded. 

You can also find these errors by running this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM MobileHandledException SINCE 24 hours ago
```

## Next steps

* Use API calls to track custom data: Our Cordova agent utilizes the same API calls as our iOS and Android SDK agents. See [iOS SDK](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/ios-sdk-api) or [Android SDK](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api).

* To update your Cordova agent version, run this simple command:

  ```
  cordova plugin update
  ```

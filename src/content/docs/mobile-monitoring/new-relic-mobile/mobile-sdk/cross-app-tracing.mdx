The `noticeHttpTransaction` code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get [cross application tracing](/docs/apm/traces/cross-application-traces/cross-application-tracing) to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's [**Map** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-dashboards/map-dashboard-mobile-apps) for mobile apps or on the [**HTTP requests** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-dashboards/http-requests-dashboard).

You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your backend application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the backend application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function.

## Example [#example] 

This example adds the `NewRelic-ID` to the backend HTTP request, with `conn` as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.)

```java
import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic;
import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId()
...
...

//new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic
public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) {
    String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID
    if (crossProcessId != null) {
        conn.setRequestProperty("X-NewRelic-ID", crossProcessId);
    }
}
```

After adding the appropriate header to the request to the backend app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the `X-Newrelic-App-Data` header, and then added to the `noticeHttpTransaction` call as a string. For example:

```java
//NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response);
//Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header
NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction("http://api.newrelic.com", "GET", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, "Test", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader);
```

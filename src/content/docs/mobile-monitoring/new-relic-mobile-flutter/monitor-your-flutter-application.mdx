Monitor your Flutter application with our New Relic Flutter agent. Capture Dart errors, track specific network requests, use distributed tracing to drill down into handled exceptions, and create custom tracking events and metrics to fully capture your end users' experience.

## Compatibility requirements [#requirements]

Before you install the Flutter agent, ensure your Flutter app meets these version requirements:

* Flutter 2.5.0 or higher
* Dart versions 2.16.2 or higher, up to but not including 3.0.0
* Android API 24 or higher
* [Android-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)
* [iOS-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements)


## Install the Flutter agent [#install]

To install the Flutter agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0gR70k5oZjo), located directly in the UI.

## View your Flutter app data in New Relic [#view-data]

Now that you've got the Flutter agent sending data to New Relic, it's time to view your app data in New Relic.

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile >** (select your Flutter app) **> Summary** to see a summary of your data over time. 

With the Flutter agent, you have access to all mobile monitoring features, such as tracking crashes, HTTP requests, and handled exceptions. Check out these feature pages for more info:
* [Mobile app summary](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-pages/mobile-apps-summary-page/#details)
* [Handled exceptions](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/handled-exceptions-analyze-trends-prevent-crashes)
* [Crash event trails](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/mobile-crash-event-trail)
* [HTTP requests](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/http-requests-page)
* [Set up alerts](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/get-started/mobile-monitoring-alert-information)

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        id="noData"
        title="**No HTTP data appears**"
    >
        If, after installing the Flutter agent and waiting at least 5 minutes, you see **No HTTP data appears:** on the **HTTP errors** and **HTTP requests** UI pages, ensure you are not overriding `HttpOverrides.global` inside your Flutter app.
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Query Flutter log data [#logs]

New Relic stores your Flutter logs as custom events. You can query these logs and build dashboards for them using this NRQL query:
```
 SELECT * FROM `Mobile Dart Console Events` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO
```

For more information on NRQL queries, see [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/#where).

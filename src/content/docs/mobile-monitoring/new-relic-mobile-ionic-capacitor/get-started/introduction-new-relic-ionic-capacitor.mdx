The official New Relic Capacitor agent for iOS and Android allows developers to easily embed the mobile agents into [Capacitor applications](https://capacitorjs.com/). Written in JavaScript, the plugin automatically includes New Relic's native agents to provide mobile monitoring and performance visibility. Once installed, the New Relic Capacitor agent can:

* Automatically instrument mobile applications built via Capacitor
* Capture JavaScript errors
* Generate distributed traces
* Track promise rejection (an unhandled exception in JavaScript)
* Track warnings and errors with console logs
* Capture interactions and their sequences
* Track user sessions

For more information, see [New Relic Capacitor agent on Github](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-capacitor-plugin).

## Compatibility requirements [#requirements]

Before you install the Capacitor agent, ensure your app meets these requirements:

* Android API 24+
* iOS 10
For Android-native apps:
    * See [Android-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)

For iOS-native apps:
    * See [iOS-native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements)

## Install

To install the Capacitor agent:

* Follow our [guided install](https://onenr.io/0VRVoxJW1ja), located directly in the UI.

## API calls [#api-calls]

Our Capacitor agent utilizes the same API calls as our iOS and Android SDK agents. Please refer to our [iOS SDK doc](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/ios-sdk-api) or [Android SDK doc](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api).

For errors specific to Capacitor, you can call `NewRelicCapacitorPlugin.recordError` as follows:

```ts
    try {
      throw new Error('Example error message');
    } catch (error: any) {
      NewRelicCapacitorPlugin.recordError({
        name: error.name,
        message: error.message,
        stack: error.stack,
        isFatal: false,
      });
    }
```

## Troubleshoot JavaScript errors [#javascript-errors]

### Capacitor agent v1.2.0 and above:
JavaScript errors can be seen in the `Handled Exceptions` tab or as a `MobileHandledException` event. You can also see these errors in the NRQL explorer using this query:

You can also find these errors by running this query:
```sql
  SELECT * FROM `MobileHandledException` SINCE 24 hours ago
```

### Capacitor agent v1.1.1 and below:
The Capacitor agent creates custom events for JavaScript errors and reports them to New Relic. In the UI, you can track these JavaScript error events with a custom dashboard.

To create a custom dashboard:
1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
2. Click **Query builder**.
3. Run this query:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM `JS Errors`
  ```
4. Click **Add to dashboard**.

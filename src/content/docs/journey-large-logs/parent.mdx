title: How to manage large log ingest 
metaDescription: 
---

Modern systems create large amounts of log data. You might be dealing with hundreds of gigabytes to dozens of terabytes today, and the amount will continue to increase as your system scales. Anything past a few gigabytes of logs means hours upon hours of troubleshooting and searching through logs when need arises. Log management solutions, like New Relic, provide the tools to handle large sets of logs and make them managable — and more important, valuable. 

This tutorial walks you through how to us New Relic to manage a large amount of log ingest. You'll start by forwarding your logs to New Relic, which means sending your log data to New Relic automatially. 

Your app is slow. Perhaps it's so slow it's causing downtime or issues in related services, or perhaps it's simply a slow back-end response that makes your UX just a little bit worse. What do you do about it? 

This tutorial walks you through how to use New Relic to triage your application and identify the root cause of your app's degraded performance. You'll start by "instrumenting" your app with an agent, which means installing a piece of code that reports data about your app to New Relic through language and framework specific integrations. Using this data in New Relic, you'll dig into the performance of your application and identify slow transactions, slow database queries, or slow external services as your issue—or possibly all three!

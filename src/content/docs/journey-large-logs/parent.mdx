title: How to manage large log ingest 
metaDescription: 
---

Modern systems create large amounts of log data. You might be dealing with hundreds of gigabytes to dozens of terabytes today, and the amount will continue to increase as your system scales. Anything past a few gigabytes of logs means hours upon hours of troubleshooting and searching through logs when need arises. Log management solutions, like New Relic, provide the tools to handle large sets of logs and make them managable — and more important, valuable. 

This tutorial walks you through how to us New Relic to manage a large amount of log ingest. You'll start by forwarding your logs to New Relic, which means sending your log data to New Relic automatically. You'll then identify what logs to ingest and which to drop. Finally you'll organize your logs through partitions and parsing.

## Choosing a log management platform [#choose]

Once you've identified you have a problem with managing logs, it's time to choose a log management platform. There are many platforms out there. Some focus on quick automation but sacrifice ease-of-use. Others focus on complex features, but obscure their pricing.

New Relic's philosphy when it comes to log management focuses on three things: we want out logs solution to be **flexible, transparent, and usage based**. Let's quickly talk about what these mean:

* **Flexible**: everyone needs different things from their logs. Some may need to ingest a large amount for record keeping while some may need to ingest a small amount. Some may need to heavily parse their logs while other may barely parse their logs at all. New Relic provides a platform flexible enough to meet everyone's needs.
* **Transparent**: 
* **Usage-based**:

## Let's begin: forward your logs [#forward]


To forward your log data to New Relic, you can use one or more of these options:

* **Use our <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agents to report logs.** By default, our APM agents do two things: add metadata to your logs, which gives you logs in context (ability to see logs data in various relevant places in our platform) and forward your logs to New Relic. This is a popular option for DevOps teams and smaller organizations because it lets you easily report application logs, with no additional third-party solutions required. [Learn more about APM logs.](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context)
* **[Use our infrastructure agent to report logs](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent).** With our infrastructure agent, you can capture any logs present on your host, including your app logs. Compared to using an APM agent to report logs, this can take a little more setting up but gives you much more powerful options (for example, ability to collect custom attributes, which you can't do with <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agents). 
* **Use third-party log services.** We have [a wide range of integrations for other log services](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic), including Amazon, Microsoft, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Kubernetes, Logstash, and more.
* **Reports logs using the [Log API](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/) or [TCP endpoint](/docs/logs/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic).**
* **Use the OpenTelemetry SDK to send logs** from your apps to an [OpenTelemetry collector](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs), which can forward them to New Relic via OTLP.

title: Filter log ingest
metaDescription: 
---

As we've talked about before, modern systems create massive amounts of logs. Not all of those are useful. In fact, there's a high chance when you look at your logs you'd find *most* aren't useful.

New Relic provides the ability to create rule sets that look at your logs and ignore logs that you haven't selected for ingest. This provides to key benefits. First, by ingesting only logs you deem useful you reduce the toil of uncovering the logs you need when they matter. Second, since New Relic bills for logs on a usage-based model, choosing which logs to ingest and which to drop can greatly affect your cost.  

## Decide which logs to drop [#decide]

## Filter your log ingest [#filter-steps]

The following steps will guide you through how to drop logs in the New Relic UI.


Let's say Acme Corp creates 2TB of logs each day. They decide this too many logs to ingest for both cost and usability reasons. They take a look at their logs and realize over half of their daily logs are from a legacy Node.js application. While they need to keep the app around, they don't care for the logs created by this app. They decided to drop all logs created from the Node app.

        ### Navigate to the UI

        1. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Create your drop rule

        Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped.

        There are a few ways to do this, but the easiest is to query for the logs you want to drop. In this case, ACME Corp would do the following:

        1. Select **All partitions** near the search bar
        2. Enter their query. In this case `logtype=node` 
        3. Press enter and confirm the correct logs appear.

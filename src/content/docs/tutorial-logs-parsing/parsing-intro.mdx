title: Why parse logs
metaDescription: "Organize your logs into managable partitions and tag their attributes with logs parsing"
---

Reading through unstructured log data is difficult and time consuming. Sending unstructured log data to an observability tool like New Relic eases some of the difficulty, but still prevents you from getting maximum value from your log data. 

Parsing your unstructured log data pulls out attributes from your logs to make it easier to navigate through them and increase their value in charts and alerts. This tutorial covers a general log parsing strategy. You'll start by setting up log forwarding if you haven't already, learn about custom parsing rules, and then you'll develop and implement your own log parsing strategy. You'll finish up by using those newly parsed logs to set up alerts and charts so you can always keep an eye on your logs.

If you want a more general overview on managing your logs, see our [how to manage large log volume](/docs/tutorial-large-logs/get-started-managing-large-logs/) tutorial series.

## Objectives [#objective]

This doc covers:

* Setting up log forwarding 
* A general overview of log parsing

## Prerequisites [#prereq]

To forward your log data to New Relic, choose one or more of these options:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Log forwarding option
            </th>
            <th>
                When to use
            </th>
            <th>
                Install
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                APM agent
            </td>
            <td>
                By default, our APM agents do three things: 
                * Add metadata to your logs, which gives you logs in context (ability to see logs data in various relevant places in our platform) 
                * Forward your logs to New Relic.
                * Report performance metrics for your application [Read more about our APM capabilities](/introduction-apm/)
                
                 This is a popular option for DevOps teams and smaller organizations because it lets you easily report application logs, with no additional third-party solutions required. [Learn more about APM logs.](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context)

With our infrastructure agent, you can capture any logs present on your host, including your app logs. 

Compared to using an APM agent to report logs, this can take a little more setting up but gives you much more powerful options (for example, ability to collect custom attributes, which you can't do with <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agents).

## Built-in vs custom log parsing


Parsing your logs at ingest is the best way to make your log data more usable by you and other users in your organization. For example, compare these two logs pre-parsing and post-parsing using a Grok parsing rule:

<SideBySide>
    <Side>
Pre-parsing:

```
{
    "message": "32 4329 store_Portland"
}


```

    </Side>
    <Side>

Post-parsing:

```
{
    "transaction_total": "32",
    "purchase_number": "4329",
    "store_location": "store_Portland",
}
```

    </Side>
</SideBySide>



This allows you to easily query for newly defined attributes such as `transaction_total` in dashboards and alerts.


### Do I need custom parsing?

* Built-in already parses all your logs
* You have no custom log solutions
* You don't care about all attributes

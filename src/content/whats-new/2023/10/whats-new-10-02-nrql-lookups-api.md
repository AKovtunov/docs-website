When the NRQL Lookups feature was added, lookup table maintenance was exposed to users via the
lookups table UI. We understand automation is crucial to our customers. Manually updating a lookup
tables through the UI each morning is not an efficient system. Now, with the Lookups Service API,
you can automate lookup table maintenance through a REST API.

The Lookups Service API facilitates management of lookup tables. In addition to uploading CSV
formatted files, tables can be defined directly in a JSON payload.

Please refer to the [Lookups Service API documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/lookups-service-api/lookups-service-api) for details.

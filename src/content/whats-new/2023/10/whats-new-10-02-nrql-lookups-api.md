When the NRQL Lookups feature was added, lookup table maintenance was made available to
users via the lookup table UI. We understand automation is crucial to our customers.
Manually updating a lookup table through the UI each morning is not an efficient system.
Now, with the NRQL Lookups API, you can automate lookup table maintenance through a REST
API.

The NRQL Lookups API facilitates management of lookup tables. In addition to uploading CSV
formatted files, tables can be defined directly in a JSON payload.

Check out
the [NRQL Lookups API documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/lookups-service-api/lookups-service-api)
for more details.

When you're alerted about a new error, determining your next steps can be daunting. Once you see that a service triggered an alert, you may see that there are hundreds or thousands of error occurrences you might need to deal with. To add more complexity, just because a service triggered an alert doesn't necessarily mean the source of those errors is in that service.

New Relic is one resource that can help you broach high numbers of errors. This tutorial series guides you through unpacking the different causes for errors, as well as some tools at your disposal to triage and analyze your errors.

## Objectives [#objectives]

In this tutorial, you will:

* Determine whether an error is expected or unexpected
* Find the source of an error with logs in context
* Triage your error to the correct team

## Instrument your site [#instrument]

To get started, install the APM agent with our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=b3815b2d-8711-4418-335b-a9cac0468fe3). Our APM agent includes the logs in context feature that we will use in this tutorial. Logs in context does not require additional instrumentation. 

## Find the errors tab [#errors-inbox]

Let's say you've been notified that one of your services has gone down, and it's affecting a critical part of your customer funnel. When you check New Relic, you see that one of your services is alerting in the red, but there's also a lot of other data to look at. Your throughput might be up, or maybe there's an uptick in your error rate.

Keep in mind that when a service alerts you, it's only alerting you that a problem is affecting that particular service. The source of the error could be elsewhere. Think of it this way: you may see flooding at the side of your house near your hose and maybe that is the source of the problem. But maybe the issue is with your water main. If you assume that the flooding has to be related to the hose without further investigation, you risk wasting valuable time and money fixing a problem that doesn't exist. Worse, the crack in your water main that's causing the flooding could extend further up the line.

Once you're aware of the problem, you'll find yourself on that service's APM summary page. In this example, we're on the summary page for `API-gateway`. You may notice three things:

* Something about data
* Something about data
* Something about data

Your first step is to check the **Errors** tab under **Triage**.

## Analyze your errors [#analyze]

The errors page has two sections to begin analysis, both with the same information. The **Triage** section lets you assign errors to people or teams. The **Group errors** page gives you a waterfall view of individual errors that make up group errors. Either page summarizes the same data.

Your errors are categorized into two categories: expected or unexpected errors. At first glance, this might seem counter intuitive, but when you're reacting to an incident like a service outage, you want to focus on your unexpected errors. These kinds of errors are anomalous and may be due to a deployment or a dependency, rather than user error or a noncritical bug in your system. 

We recommend you take these steps when analyzing your errors:

1. Compare the different errors between the the error rate and error count graphs. Even if one error type is high, if its count extends beyond the incident time frame, then you can assume it's an expected error. 
2. Adjust the time picker with a custom time frame when the initial spike in errors occurred.
3. Click the error group you want to focus on. This will bring up another page with details about logs, stack traces, distributed traces, and error attributes relating to the error occurrence.
